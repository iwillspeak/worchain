# Worchain

Markov chain word generator for [Typioca](https://github.com/bloznelis/typioca).

This project is a proof of concept for generating words using Markov Chains in a format that can be consumed by Typioca. The idea here is that you can practice typing on English-like words while being forced to concentrate more on accuracy as some words are partially nonsense.

Inspired in part by the practice text of <https://keybr.com>.
