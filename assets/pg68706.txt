PREFACE.


In the modernized and revised edition of “House-Plans for Everybody,”
but little attempt has been made to change the text or floor plans, as
these are standard features requiring no revision. In the matter of
outward dress, however, nearly all the elevations have been redrawn, with
special regard to modern ideas and tastes, and in this respect it is
specially new and commendable. The author has been guided in this work
by many years’ experience, in planning and superintending the erection
of country buildings, and has selected, from an extensive aggregation
of original designs in his possession, such examples as seemed best to
serve for purposes of simplicity, comfort, and economy. All the matters
here presented are purely practical—well calculated to assist such as
are contemplating the erection of either a village or country house.
The plans embrace almost every variety of arrangement and style—each
one is accompanied with a detailed description of its conveniences
and construction—and its cost is shown by careful estimates, made to
correspond with a uniform standard of prices, at present rates. To
builders, this work will be valuable as a handbook of reference, to aid
them when applied to for suggestions, either in the projection of new
dwellings, or in the alteration of old ones, saving much time, study and
calculations. The estimates of cost have been found correct as to totals,
in the neighborhood of New York, and in many other localities builders
have offered to duplicate the structures for the figures given.

DESIGN I.

A COTTAGE, COSTING $250.


This plan was designed for a simple cottage, with sufficient
accommodations for beginners in housekeeping with limited means. It is
arranged as the _Wing_ of a larger house to be erected in the future, as
indicated in the dotted sketch adjoining the ground-plan. (The building,
with the proposed enlargements complete, are given in Design VIII.)
To a certain extent, one’s dwelling is an index of his character. Any
effort at building expresses the owner’s ability, taste, and purpose.
Every industrious man, starting in life, has a right, and should be
encouraged, to anticipate prosperity, as the sure reward of honest
worth; and he may, with propriety, give emphasis to such anticipations
in every step, and with every blow struck. His dwelling may well express
the progressive character, rather than a conclusive result. Beginning a
home by starting with a room or two, as present means will allow, and
increasing its dimensions as can be afforded, without the precarious aid
of the money-lender, is honest, independent, and best provides against
the ever-changing vicissitudes of life. The first step towards building
is the preparation of plans. These should be sufficiently comprehensive
to embrace all probable requirements. If only a small beginning is
intended, it should be made to exhibit some degree of completeness, and
be arranged to conform with the proposed future enlargements without
serious alterations.... EXTERIOR, (fig. 1).—In view of the relation
this structure is to bear to a proposed main house, and to allow for
the grading likely to be required in the ultimate completion of the
whole, the foundation is made to show four feet above the ground. Such
elevation adds to the prominence and good appearance of the building, and
relieves the interior from the dampness likely to result from a closer
contact with the soil. The style is simple, neat, and favorable for the
using of ordinary materials and methods of construction.... INTERIOR,
(fig. 2).—Hight of ceiling, 9 feet. The entire floor space is utilized
in the three convenient divisions—a Living-room, Bedroom, and a Large
Pantry—with no chimney-breast, or stairway to interfere. Each room is
pleasantly lighted, and the larger one has outside entrances front and
rear. With a favorable location, the living-room may be made a very
cheerful apartment.... CONSTRUCTION.—For economy, and in prospect of a
future enlargement, that shall include ample cellars, such excavations
are omitted for this building. The Foundations are brick piers,
extending in the earth below the reach of frost, and 4 feet above, and
the intermediate spaces are close-boarded, making an inclosure useful
for many purposes. If desired, a sort of temporary cellar may be made,
by deepening the central portion of this inclosure a foot or two, and
banking the loose earth against the inside of the boarding. The Framework
and other parts are substantially constructed, of materials as indicated
in the appended estimate. The Chimney rests on the central partition
(which is strengthened by the central pier of the foundation), and has
two flues, with metal thimbles in the bottom of each—one to receive the
stove-pipe from the living-room, and the other to serve as a ventilator
for the bedroom. All of the materials are intended to be of merchantable
quality. The siding, flooring, and casings are mill-dressed. The sizes of
the sash are 2 ft. 8 in. × 5 ft. 2 in., and of the doors, 2 ft. 8 in. × 6
ft. 8 in., all 1¼ in. thick, and may be found ready-made, and seasoned,
in the stock of any regular dealer.... In the following _estimate_, the
item of $20, for carpenter’s labor, may seem very little. This amount
is allowed for preparing the building ready for the plasterer, and is
entered in this manner for convenience in making the calculations. Adding
to the above amount the cost of such labor in the “completed” parts, will
make a total of $50.

ESTIMATE, cost of materials and labor:

DESIGN II.

COUNTRY COTTAGE, COSTING $450 TO $550.


This plan of an inexpensive country dwelling is adapted to the wants
of many people whose circumstances will not admit of a larger outlay.
It was originally prepared and published in response to many calls for
very low-priced country houses, “some as cheap as lumber and nails can
make them.” The present one approximates that point, and will aid in
devising others.... TWO ELEVATIONS are given for the same ground-plan;
the first (fig. 3) is for a one-story house of the simplest design,
with an entrance door, a neat porch, and two windows in front. The rear
is arranged similarly. The roof is conspicuous, in keeping with its
importance. No matter how cheaply one proposes to build a house, it is
essential not to slight the roof. A roof fit for a one-story cottage
would answer equally well on a three-story house, so that relatively the
cost of this part becomes greater, as the other parts become reduced
and cheapened.... GROUND-PLAN, (fig. 4).—The accommodations are quite
sufficient for a small family, consisting of three rooms, two lobbies,
a kitchen-pantry, and a clothes-press. The Lobbies protect the rooms
from direct contact with the outside doors. The Living-room is large,
and accessible alike from each entrance; it has windows front and rear,
and is convenient to the pantry; one entire side is unbroken, giving
additional space for furniture, etc. The Pantry is shelved on two sides,
and has a sash opening from the rear lobby, receiving light through the
head-light over the rear entrance door. The front Bedroom is of good
size—large enough to be used as a sitting-room; it adjoins the rear
bedroom, and a clothes-press, and has a window facing the road. The
rear Bedroom is the most retired, and has a window looking to the rear.
The Press or closet is shelved and hooked in the usual manner. The door
between the bedrooms might be dispensed with, but its convenience more
than repays its cost.... CONSTRUCTION.—The Foundations are of common
stone and mortar, laid in trenches, so as not to be affected by frost,
and show 1½ feet above ground. The supports for the central partitions
are stone piers, 4 feet apart. The Chimneys are of hard brick and mortar,
passing through the first story in two flues, but joined together beneath
the roof, and finished above as a single chimney. All the timber of the
exterior frame is of 4 × 6-inch spruce. The sills are laid flatways on
the foundation, and the upright frame-work stands upon them. The beams
are of 1¼ × 8-inch spruce planks; they are notched 4 inches, to fit on
the sill, and bear on the foundation, and are nailed to the studding and
sills, binding the whole together. The ceiling-strips are of 1¼ × 5-inch
spruce, resting on the ties, and nailed to the studding. The rafters are
2 × 4-inch wall-strips. All beams, studding, and rafters, are placed
16 inches apart from centers. The siding is of 10-inch dressed pine.
The roof is covered with 18-inch pine shingles, laid on 1¼ × 2-inch
shingling-lath. The porch-frame is of dressed and cornered timber, and
is roofed with shingles on flooring laid face down. The flooring is 1⅛
× 9-inch spruce “milled.” The interior is plainly cased: for doors and
windows, 3¼ inches wide; base, 6 inches; chair-back in the living-room, 3
inches; all beveled. All sashes and doors are 1¼ inch thick. The interior
side-walls and ceilings are white-sand finished, on brown mortar and
seasoned lath. Many efforts have been made to devise something cheaper
than plastering for the inside lining of walls, but no substitute has
yet been found to equal it in cheapness or durability. Plastering, as
usually prepared and applied, conduces to the healthfulness of any
apartment, emits no odor of mouldiness, has no attraction or harbor for
vermin, is impervious to air, and a non-conductor of sound. Where linings
of thin wood or paper are used, it is necessary to deafen the partitions
and ceilings, otherwise they will be noisy. Sound made in any one part
will reverberate through the house with drum-like suggestiveness. Most of
such materials absorb moisture rapidly from the atmosphere, and when at
any distance from the house-fires, so as not to be warmed and dried, the
moisture is retained in them. This is especially the case in chambers and
closets. Rather than seek a substitute for plastering, it is better to
extend its use, and, where practicable, apply it as an outside covering,
as well as for inside linings, as described for Design VI. The SECOND
ELEVATION, (fig. 5,) shows an enlargement of the first, by increasing the
outlines of the roof, giving space for a SECOND FLOOR, (fig. 6). Such
space, though not immediately required for bedrooms, would be valuable
for many purposes. The appearance of the building is improved by the
enlargement, and the extra cost will not exceed one hundred dollars.

DESIGN III.

A COUNTRY COTTAGE, COSTING $550.


These plans are for a low-priced house, similar in character to those
in Design II., but differing entirely in outlines and arrangement,
and embracing a much larger area of floor space, with increased
accommodations.... ELEVATION, (fig. 7.)—The Front is broken with angles,
furnishing a greater number of vertical lines, thus giving relief from
the depressing appearance that would otherwise be manifest. The roof
projections are proportionate, with simple finish. The cornices of the
central or main part are the most prominent, and have plain trusses. The
gable openings supplying ventilation between the ceilings and roof....
GROUND-PLAN, (fig. 8).—The interior contains five quite ample rooms,
conveniently arranged, besides a lobby, pantry, and two closets. Hight
of ceilings in two principal rooms, 9½ feet, in the side extensions, 6
feet at the plate, following the rafters to the center of the rooms,
and from thence are leveled across at the hight of 9 feet. The front
entrance is through a lobby. (If desired to economize further, the
front stoop and one door may be saved, by putting an arch in place
of the front door, making a recessed porch of the lobby.) The Parlor
has two front windows, and a closet, and adjoins the kitchen and two
bedrooms. The Kitchen is large, has two windows, an open fire-place,
and adjoins a commodious pantry, and a bedroom. The Pantry has a large
window, and is shelved on one side and end. A convenient Clothes-press
opens from the right-hand bedroom. The Chimney is near the center of
the house, insuring much saving of heat. The interior of this house may
be comfortably warmed from a single fire, by placing a Radiator in the
parlor, and leading the fire-draught from the kitchen stove through it.
As the peculiar form and construction of this radiator is comparatively
new, having originated with me, a description is here given, which will
enable any skillful sheet-iron worker to make one (see figs. 9 and 10):
_A_, is the parlor side of the chimney-breast; _B_, the kitchen side;
_C_, chimney-flue; _D_, kitchen fire-place, containing kitchen-stove;
_E_, smoke-pipe leading from the stove through the throat-piece, into
the chimney-flue; _F_, _F_, stove-pipe branches passing through the
back of the fire-place, and connecting the smoke-pipe, _E_, with the
radiator; _G_, interior section of radiator; _H_, face of radiator; _I_,
partition within radiator. The draught is regulated by a damper, _J_,
in the smoke-pipe _E_, between the branches, _F_, _F_, and is forced
through the radiator as required. The radiator may be made of any size
desired to fit the mantle-opening, and if neatly constructed of Russian
iron, will be quite ornamental. The partition, _I_, is 5 inches wide,
and extends to within 6 inches of the bottom at either side, has turned
edges, and is riveted to the front and back. In use, to start the fire, a
direct draught is made by opening the damper, _J_, after which it may be
closed to turn the draught through the lower branch-pipe into the central
part of the radiator, where it descends, passing the lower ends of the
partition, _I_, into the side passages, where it ascends and enters the
upper branch-pipe, leading to the smoke-pipe, _E_. The bottom should
have a collar to slide within the upright part, to facilitate cleaning
when necessary. If there is no hearth-stone to set the radiator upon,
the bottom may be filled with an inch deep of coarse plaster, which
will make it safe even on a carpet. In setting the radiator, an inch or
two of open space should be left between it and the chimney-back (just
the thickness of the interior wall-plates of the mantle, against which
the radiator should join.) Into the bottom of this space, air may be
introduced from the outside of the house, through a two-inch pipe. The
air thus let in becomes heated, and escapes around the margin, furnishing
a pure healthful supply to the room.... CONSTRUCTION.—The estimate
annexed, includes materials, and methods of construction similar to those
described for Design II. The form and arrangement of this building admits
of its being erected in sections; the central or main part may be first
put up, and the side extensions added as means or necessity requires or
allow. In localities where it is difficult to get dressed lumber, rough
boards may be used for the siding, put on vertically, and battened, but
in this case it would be practical to paint the cornices and other
dressings only with lead and oil—using a lime-wash for the rough work.
A durable wash may be made by slaking freshly-burned lump-lime in hot
brine. This can be colored by adding dry-stainers as desired, and may be
applied with an ordinary whitewash brush. Such work would greatly reduce
the cost, and, if properly done, add a feature of rustic beauty, quite
becoming in this class of building.

DESIGN IV.

A COUNTRY HOUSE, COSTING $550 TO $700.


This plan of a low-priced dwelling is adapted to the wants of many
living in the country. It will accommodate a small family well, and
has a pleasing appearance.... EXTERIOR, (fig. 11.)—The Front has a
sufficient variety of parts to insure a fair degree of picturesqueness.
An allowable amount of neat tracery is admitted in the composition of
the gables, and between the piazza columns, to give an expression of
taste and cheerfulness. More than this would not accord with the utility
and economy especially aimed at in these low-priced plans. If intended
for a Summer Cottage, or Gate-lodge, for persons of larger means, the
matter of exterior dress would assume quite a different aspect, and admit
of more liberal treatment.... GROUND-PLAN, (fig. 12.)—The arrangement
shown is adapted to an _eastward_ frontage, placing the Entrances and
the Living-room on the pleasant side, where least exposed to northerly
winds and cold. Should an opposite frontage be selected, the plan may
be suited to it by reversing the sides, as this would be reflected if
held before a mirror. The hight of the ceilings are 10 feet. The front
entrances open directly from the piazza to the parlor and living-room.
These entrances may be protected in winter by a sash inclosure, forming
a pleasant vestibule of a part of the piazza. The principal rooms are
a Parlor, Kitchen, and two Bedrooms. The Parlor is in front of the
main building, and of sufficient size for the ordinary uses of such
an apartment. The Kitchen is intended as the Living-room, where the
family, maintaining the simplicity of cottage life, spend much of their
in-door time, sharing together the domestic cares and comforts. It is
sufficiently spacious to admit of the requisite furniture, and allow of
the ordinary family gathering without crowding. It has three windows;
if desired, the upper part of the front door may have sashes, giving
views in three directions. The pantry and lobby, at the rear, are of
equal size, both opening from the kitchen. The two Bedrooms adjoin each
other (but have no communication between them in the plan. This may be
arranged as desired.) One opens from the parlor, the other from the
kitchen, and each has a closet. The Chimney is placed between the kitchen
and parlor, with an open fire-place on the kitchen side. The method of
heating, described for Design III., would insure the comfortable warming
of both of the principal rooms from one kitchen fire.... CELLAR, (fig.
13.)—Hight, 6½ feet. The dimensions embrace the space below the kitchen
and the bedrooms; it has three windows and an outside entrance. The part
under the parlor is unexcavated.... CONSTRUCTION.—The Foundation-walls
are of broken stone and mortar, and show 2 feet above ground. Those under
the parlor are laid in trenches, extending below the reach of frost.
The chimney is of hard brick and mortar. The frame-work, roofing, and
exterior plastering, are similar to those described for Design VI. The
gables are inclosed with vertical boarding, having their lower ends cut
to pattern, and are battened over the joints. The ornamental verges in
the gable-cornices are of pine boards, and, being of simple design, are
readily made, and put in position while building. A pleasing effect is
produced by “lining off” the surface of the exterior plastering into
courses or squares. This is easily done with a “straight-edge,” and an
=S= shaped iron while finishing. The final “Stearate” covering (see
Design VI.) may be divided and shaded in two parts, and so applied as
to give the alternate squares slight changes of shade. The best results
may be obtained from _exterior plastering_ where properly done. It
is impervious to either air or water, and therefore equals the more
expensive methods of inclosures for houses of this character. It should
not be attempted over _horizontal_ lines of framework, as the shrinking
and consequent contraction will cause a bulging and cracking of the
plaster at those points. Whenever obliged to cross such timbers, the
upright framework must be halved on to them, and continued in whole
lengths, to prevent such contractions. All joinings with the exterior
wood-finish must be carefully made, especially at the top, to prevent
water from entering, and running down behind the walls. Wide projectives
of cornices afford a valuable protection for such walls against driving
storms. Exterior plastering may be done in any season that is free from
frost. An ordinary rain will do no injury to either of the two coats of
plaster after they have become “set.” The “Stearate” should be applied as
soon as the plastering is thoroughly dried.

DESIGN V.

A CONVENIENT HOUSE, COSTING $650.


The accompanying plans were designed for a simple, compact, and
economical house, and will be appreciated by any one who may desire
to know just how little is required to build a comfortable home. They
provide ample room for a small family.... The CELLAR extends under the
whole house, the walls are built as shown in the details of foundation
and frame, given in Design VI., with 3 feet of masonry and 3 feet of
frame-work.... The FIRST STORY contains a good-sized Hall, Parlor, and
Kitchen, or Living-room, with two closets, pump, and sink. The stairs
to the cellar lead directly from the kitchen, passing down under the
stairs in the main hall. A “fire-place heater” can be put in the parlor
fire-place, which will also warm the chamber above. This method of
heating is economical, and occupies but little room.... The SECOND
STORY has three good-sized rooms, two closets, and small hall, in the
main house, and an attic over the kitchen. The floor of the attic is
one foot lower than that of the main house; this gives valuable room
for storage, etc.... The hight of the first story of the main house is
8 feet 6 inches; of the second story, 7 feet. The hight of the kitchen
ceiling is 7½ feet. The attic is arranged to have just standing room in
the center.... A great saving of time and trouble is made, when openings
are provided for _regular sizes_ of sash, blinds, and doors, as they
may be obtained of seasoned and well-made stock, at any time, from any
dealer in such materials. These plans are drawn with reference to such
regular sizes, viz.: the first-story windows are 2 ft. 7 in. × 5 ft. 6
in.; second story, 2 ft. 7 in. × 4 ft. 6 in.; cellar, 2 ft. × 2 ft. 8
in., all 1¼ inch thick. All principal windows should have their frames
made with pockets and pulleys, and the sash hung with iron weights and
good cord. The cost for the addition of these necessary parts, beyond
what is required for the plain frame, is about as follows, for each
window of ordinary size: 4 pulleys, (at 40c. per doz.) 14c.; 20 lbs.
iron weights, 2½c. per lb., 50c.; ½ lb. sash-cord, 16c. per lb., 8c;
1 doz. screws, ⅞ in., 35c. per gross, 3c.; labor putting in pockets,
pulleys, etc., 20 c.—Total, 95 cents, and when once done, will need no
further attention or expense, while the house lasts. The satisfaction of
having neat-fitting, easy-working sash, where the upper, or lower one,
may be opened at will, is great. The saving of little fingers, and older
nerves, to say nothing of shattered sash and glass, more than repays
the extra cost of hanging sash.... The front, rear, and parlor DOORS
are 2 ft. 8 in. × 6 ft. 8 in. × 1½ in.; other first-story doors, 2 ft.
6 in. × 6 ft. 8 in. × 1¼ in.; second-story doors, 3 ft. 6 in. × 6 ft.
6 in. × 1¼ in.; all 4-paneled, and neatly moulded. The 1½-inch doors
have mortise-locks; other doors rim-locks, all with porcelain knobs and
escutcheons.... BLINDS are included for the first and second stories,
in the estimate appended, at an average cost of $2.40 per pair, and
may be omitted, but are recommended as useful; they protect the sash
from storms, and can be operated to give almost any desired light or
shade in the rooms.... Many people may be in circumstances that would
justify the building of one part of a house first, to be occupied as a
temporary residence until means and opportunity warrant the building of
the whole. A newly-married couple could arrange to have the kitchen part
built as a residence for a season, rather than forego the opportunity
of setting out trees, vines, and shrubbery, planting, and otherwise
developing their grounds. They would then be near the work when building
the main part, to superintend it, and care for materials, saving much
that is often wasted, or lost. The wing, or kitchen part, could be
built at a cost of about $185, so arranged as that the main house could
be joined to it at any time—or, what would be better, the main house
may be built first, at a cost of about $650, and the kitchen added at
convenience.... The exterior dressing of cornice, window-caps, and stoop,
are decided in their character for simplicity and boldness, giving a
generous and finished appearance to the whole.... NOVELTY SIDING, fig.
18, is mentioned in many of the estimates for these houses. This form of
siding I first introduced some sixteen years ago, since which time it
has grown into general favor and use in this neighborhood. It has the
following merits to recommend it: 1st, It is easily put on by ordinary
mechanics. 2d, When properly nailed to the frame, it strengthens it,
so as to make bracing of the frame almost unnecessary. 3d, The spaces
between the studding, when the interior is plastered, are each air-tight
compartments, containing only stationary air, which is a non-conductor of
cold (or heat), thus protecting the inside wall from the extreme changes
of outward temperature. 4th, A cheaper quality of lumber can be used, the
more cross-grained the materials, the less likely they are to check, or
shrink, and any small, sound knots are easily covered with shellac before
painting, which closes them effectually. 5th, The general surface is
even, so that any brackets or other ornamentation can be put on without
the trouble and difficulty of “scribing” them up to the clap-boarding....
The SHINGLING referred to in the estimate is of 18-inch pine shingles,
and may be laid 5¾ inch to the weather, and secured with large-headed
“shingle-nails.” It is best in laying shingles to lap at one-third the
breadth, never in the center, for should one shingle check in the center,
as they are liable to do, an opening is made through the three courses,
and a leaky roof will be the result. “Shingling-lath” 1¼ × 2 in., with
the lower edge placed just where the buts of the shingles would cover,
will allow air to freely circulate on both sides of the shingles, and
preserve them one-third longer than when laid on close planking, which
holds the moisture, and assists decay of every part of the roof....
GUTTERS.—The old wooden gutter has nearly gone into disuse, and always
seemed a barrier to any satisfactory finish of cornice. It was difficult
to get timber of sufficient width for projections, and in such cases, the
cornices were proportioned by boxing off, and building up around this
“gutter-stick,” which was bad construction—the outer-edge of the gutter,
being higher than the edge next the house, would cause the water, during
heavy storms, or when the leader was choked up, to flow over against the
frame-work of the building, which was one of the most frequent causes of
decay and settling in the older houses in this country.—The tin-lined
“box” and “trough” gutters are often troublesome; the tin can not be
laid in them except in long lengths, which have been soldered together
while flat and smooth. To lay these long lengths into the ready-formed
gutter, requires much bending and hammering, which breaks the best tin
at the soldered joints, on the under-side, where it is impossible to
repair it, so that, while it may not appear at once to leak, it is sure
to do so soon, to be discovered after the cornice has been swelled out
of shape or destroyed. The gutter that I have adopted in all cases where
practicable (see section, fig. 19), either for shingles or slate, is
made of charcoal-tin, 14 inches wide, in lengths as long as can be well
handled. One edge is turned or rolled up around a ⅝ iron rod, which makes
a strong edge. Then a bend is made at 3½ inches from the turned edge,
forming a right angle the whole length. This is laid on the second course
of shingles, with one end lower than the other, so as to give a good run
for the water. The ends are turned up, where required, to stop the water,
and a tube put through the cornice in the usual manner.... For TIN ROOFS,
having a pitch of at least one inch to the foot, the gutters are formed
in a similar manner, with the flat, or bottom part, about ½ inch wide,
making a flange, which is soldered to the roof near the eaves, to a line
drawn at an angle to make one end lower than the other, as for shingle
roofs. This is the simplest and best kind of gutter, will outlast any
other, and in the event of a possible damage, or leakage, no harm will be
done beyond the loss or waste of the water that runs off over the eaves.
It can be easily repaired, or replaced at any time, without interfering
with the principal roof, and it saves the trouble and expense of building
and boxing for gutters, or of making cornices with special reference to
them, and it is cheaply constructed.—ESTIMATE OF COST of building by this

DESIGN VI.

A HOUSE COSTING $700.


The plans here given are of simple design, intended to meet the large
and increasing demand for low-priced country or village houses, having
at the same time some architectural beauty. Without this latter feature,
a comfortable house of this size can, in many places, be erected for
much less than $700 even.... The house here described provides for as
much room as a small family would require, while at the same time it
admits of future enlargement, as one’s necessity or means may indicate,
by additions, ells, or wings, at either side, or rear. In all cases, when
planning small houses, it is best to provide for such enlargements. The
triplet window in front is so arranged that it can be readily changed
to a bay-window, when that improvement can be afforded, without marring
the rest of the wood-work, or the harmony of the front elevation....
The Cornice of the main building is bracketed, and projects sufficient
to relieve it of the stunted look so common to country houses. The
brackets are made of 2 × 4-inch timber, in three pieces each, mitred
to the angles required, and nailed together (see fig. 25), making an
effective support and pleasant appearance.... A large saving in expense
of foundations is secured by the following method of construction (see
section of foundation and frame, fig. 24). The excavation is made for the
cellar 2½ feet deep. A foundation of 8-inch brick-work, 3 feet high, or
6 inches above the level of the ground only, is required. A sill of 3 ×
8-inch timber is laid on, and “flush” with the inside of the wall, to
provide nailing for the wainscoting of the basement, if it is afterwards
finished off.... The beams or joists for the first floor are supported
by a plank-strip five inches wide, let into the inside of the frame at a
proper hight, and securely fastened with heavy nails. The other parts of
the framing are executed, and the whole raised, in the usual manner....
The inclosing, or siding, below the first story, is of 10-inch boards
rabbeted and cross-grooved in imitation of large stone-work, and painted
in contrast with the principal body of the house, and the water-table
is put just above them.... Many small houses in the country are built
without any permanent foundation, but are temporarily supported on
posts set in the ground, and “boarded down.” They are always shaky, and
doubtful while they stand, and are frequently blown over altogether.
As will be readily seen, the above method provides for the saving of
one-half of the mason-work in the foundation. In many places stone is
abundant, and will answer the same purpose as brick in this case, except
for the 6 inches above ground. The laying up of a single-face wall, 2½
feet high, of rough stone and mortar, would cost but a trifle. If the
cellar should be finished at any time for basement purposes, these walls
would be much drier and more healthful than when the walls are entirely
of masonry. In this case it would be preferable to have the foundation
walls 6 inches higher, so as to have the basement rooms 7 feet in the
clear.... Several houses have been built on this plan in villages, and in
most cases it has been decided not to have any rear outside door for the
first story (fig. 22), but to wait until a kitchen could be finished in
the front part of the cellar, when the common entrance would be by the
area to the kitchen. In the plan (fig. 22), we have indicated two rear
windows, but a door may take the place of either of them. We have also
indicated by dotted lines where pantry, sink, etc., may be placed in the
corner, according to the wishes of the proprietor.... There is but one
chimney. The parlor is heated by running a stove-pipe through earthen
thimbles placed in the partitions under the stairs, to the chimney, which
is perfectly safe, and no heat is lost. When desired, a fire-place, or
stove-pipe flue, may be carried up through the parlor, as well as through
the living-room, and the two be brought together above the stairs into
one chimney.... The SECOND STORY, (fig. 23), may be divided into three
rooms, the front one being 12 × 15 feet; or, if preferred, this front
room may be divided into two smaller rooms, as indicated by the dotted
lines. One may be 8 × 12, and the other 6½ × 12. The latter would be
large enough for an ordinary bed (4½ × 6½ feet), with stand or chair by
the window; and in this case a small closet could be cut off from the
corner, opening into the large room, as shown by the dotted lines.

COST.—The following estimate in detail, at present prices, near this
city, will enable any one to determine the cost of building by this plan.
Allowance can be made for any difference in cost of materials or labor as
required in other localities:

     43 yards excavation, at 20c. per yard.                          $8.60

DESIGN VII.

COUNTRY HOUSE, COSTING $750 TO $1,050.


These plans represent a commodious dwelling house, constructed with
especial regard for economy and utility, and they will be appreciated
by those desiring to provide a comfortable, permanent shelter for home
by the use of limited means.... ELEVATION, (fig 26).—In preparing
plans for “low-priced” houses, the simplest outlines are indicated.
Having to combine usefulness and small outlay, there can be no latitude
for architectural display, beyond mere matters of accommodation and
completeness. The exterior of this example fairly expresses its domestic
purpose. The breadth of the front, the preponderance of horizontal lines,
and the hooded roof, are each indicative of strength, and suggest its
adaptation to rural situations. The satisfactory appearance of this
house will greatly depend on its location. The best results would be
obtained by placing it on a slight knoll, giving it additional altitude.
This would prevent its being obscured by shrubbery and trees, which
are indispensable accompaniments of a properly developed homestead....
CELLAR, (fig. 27).—Hight, 6½ feet. It has three windows, an outside
entrance, and stairway leading to the kitchen above.... FIRST STORY,
(fig. 28.)—Hight of ceiling, 10 feet. The accommodations, consisting
of five rooms, a pantry, and two closets, are adapted to a good-sized
family. The Parlor and Kitchen are the principal rooms, and occupy the
middle portion, their sides being protected by other rooms, and, having
the fire-place between them, they are easily warmed. The device for
heating _described_ for Design III. would serve admirably in this house.
Two Bedrooms adjoin the parlor. Many might choose to have _double_ doors
entering these bedrooms, to allow all three rooms to be used together
occasionally. This would not preclude the use of the smaller ones as
bedrooms, or, if preferred, as a sewing-room and a library. The Kitchen
is the largest apartment, and has doors leading to the pantry, bedroom,
parlor, stairway, and the rear entrance. The outside or entrance doors
may be protected in severe seasons by storm-doors hung to open outward,
with loose joint-buts to allow of their ready removal. The rear veranda
is similar to the front one shown on the elevation.... SECOND STORY,
(fig. 29).—The front portion only is finished, with ceilings 8 feet high,
and is divided into two chambers and four closets. The rear portion
is left unfinished, to be used as an open garret. The space above the
ceiling of the finished portion may be floored over with boards, to
serve for storage of quilting-frames, trunks, etc.... CONSTRUCTION.—The
excavations for the cellar are 4 feet deep. The foundation-walls are of
broken stone, laid in mortar, and show 2 feet above the earth-grade. A
strong girder, resting on large posts, or columns of stone or brick,
supports the center of the building. In setting the girder, it should be
elevated from ½ to ¾ of an inch in the center, rising gradually from each
end, to allow for settling, which invariably occurs from shrinkage of the
interior frame-work. The timber for the frame-work is indicated in the
estimates below, and is substantially framed together. All the outside
studding is _halved_ over the principal timbers, to prevent vertical
shrinkage from affecting the exterior covering of the side-walls. The
exterior covering is of lath and plaster, as follows: all cornices
and other dressings, and the roof, should first be completed—and all
window and door frames set and cased. The outside frame should then be
thoroughly lathed outside and inside. _All this is to prevent jarring
or pounding on these parts during the application or setting of the
plaster._ The plaster is made in the usual manner of fresh lime and sharp
sand, with half a bushel of hair to each barrel of lime used, and allowed
to lay two weeks to insure a thorough slaking and permeation of the lime.
It is then applied in two coats—the first a “scratch,” the second a
“browning.” The surface is floated with a darby, (not trowelled). After
having stood a sufficient time to become dry, the whole is covered with
a preparation called “Stearate of Lime,” using an ordinary white-wash
brush. The formula for making this stearate of lime (known only to a
few, who have treated it as a secret,) is here published for the first
time, and it will be understood by those familiar with the nature and
operation of slaking lime. The ingredients are simply fresh-burned
finishing-lime, using the lumps only, unrendered beef-suet, and hot
water. It is necessary that these parts be kept in lively motion while
dissolving, or they will be entirely destroyed by “burning.” The usual
process is to sink a large barrel, having an open end, 2 feet in the
ground, pounding the earth around to make it firm. An upright piece, 4
inches in diameter, and 6 feet long, is set upright in the center of the
barrel, and held in position by cleats at the bottom and top, leaving
the upright free to turn. Arms are put through the upright within the
barrel, and a cross-bar or lever is attached to the upper end—the whole
making an apparatus similar to a “clay-mill.” One bushel of lime, 20
lbs. of suet (chopped fine), and a barrel of boiling water are provided;
and while one works the “mill,” another feeds alternately lime, suet,
and hot water. This quantity of material, costing about $2, will make
a full barrel of the preparation. Any desired shade may be afterwards
given by adding stainers. This mixture is applied while hot—two coats
being necessary to insure a thorough covering. This will also be found a
valuable preparation for covering exterior brick or concrete work. It is
impervious to water, and will outlast any of the paints prepared for such
purpose. All other information concerning the finish of this house may be
inferred upon a careful study of the following estimates.—ESTIMATE cost

DESIGN VIII.

A COTTAGE, COSTING $800 TO $1,050.


This design is an enlargement of the small cottage described in Design
I. The arrangements are very complete in convenience, appearance, and
economy.... EXTERIOR, (fig. 30).—The outlines and style are simple.
The front is enlivened by the Porch, Bay-Window, and other projections.
The details of finish are of neat design, and in harmony, giving an
agreeable expression of taste and refinement—features especially pleasing
in cottage architecture.... CELLAR, (fig. 31).—Hight in clear, 6½ feet.
It is under the main building only; has two windows, and stairs leading
to the first story. It contains 378 feet area, giving abundant room for
all ordinary requirements.... FIRST STORY, (fig. 32).—Hight of ceiling,
9 feet. The best use is made of the space by having but few divisions,
leaving good-sized rooms. The Hall is small, but is conveniently arranged
to answer all necessary purposes. It is entered from the front porch, and
communicates directly with the parlor and dining-room, and by the main
stairs with the second story. There is sufficient room for a hat-rack
at the right of the front door. The Parlor is of fair size, the large
bay-window adding materially to its area and cheerfulness. With very
little expense in furniture, this apartment may be made pleasant and
cosey. The Dining-room extends the whole width of the house, and has a
window at each end. It is conveniently arranged, with doors opening from
the hall, parlor, kitchen, pantry, and to the stairs. The Kitchen is
commodious and pleasant; has three windows, an outside rear entrance, and
adjoins the dining-room, pantry, and bedroom. The Pantry is sufficiently
large and convenient to answer the requirements of both dining-room and
kitchen. It has a small window, and is thoroughly shelved. The Bedroom
opens directly from the kitchen. Its purpose in the partial erection
(as shown in Design I.) may be changed in the completed building here
described by making it an auxiliary of the kitchen for the coarser
work; or, if needed, it may still be used as a bedroom for help....
SECOND STORY, (fig. 33).—Hight of ceiling, 8 feet. There is a hall, two
chambers, two bedrooms, and two closets, in this story, and no waste
room. The Hall is just large enough for convenience. The Chambers are
of ample dimensions, with a chimney between them, admitting the use of
stoves when required.... CONSTRUCTION.—The Foundations for the main
house are of broken stone and mortar, showing three feet above ground,
neatly pointed where exposed to sight. The Wing is supported on piers,
as described in Design I. Girders (shown on the cellar-plan by dotted
lines), supported on strong posts, carry the central portions of the
building. The shortness of the spans between bearings allow very light
floor-beams. It is, however, important that the beams should be _bridged_
to secure uniformity of strength, and prevent vibrations. The Frame is
constructed in the usual manner—all the ties, girts, and headers being
“framed in.” The inclosing is sufficiently indicated in the estimate. The
front windows have semi-circular heads outside. In their construction
the frames and sash are square, to admit ordinary curtain fixtures on
the inside. The circular head is outside of, and “planted” on the flat
casing, or “blind-strip,” and is made perfectly tight by a flange of
tin. The additional expense of such circular finish is but trifling,
compared with its good appearance. The side and rear windows have square
heads, with rabbeted drips. Blinds are intended for all windows above
the cellar. Ventilators are placed in each gable. The Porch has boxed
pedestals and columns, scroll-sawed balusters, and circular spandrels.
The inside walls and ceilings are “sand-finished” on two coats of
brown mortar. The main stairs are constructed with a quarter circle,
and winders at the top. These winders extend beyond the hall into the
ceilings of the dining-room (as sketched), but do not interfere with its
use, or seriously injure its appearance. The Bay-Window is neatly arched
on the inside. Marble mantels are put in the parlor and dining-room, and
shelves in the chambers. The second story-hall is lighted through the
door (sash) of the front bedroom.... SUGGESTIONS.—This plan was arranged
to suit a village lot 25 feet in width, leaving a passage-way at the
side. This necessitated placing the wing at the rear of the main house.
If there is more ground, the wing may be placed at the right of the main
part, facing the road. The communications between the dining-room and
wing would be still similar to those shown. The window at the right of
the dining-room would be placed in the rear. These changes entail no
extra expense, if determined on before commencing to build.—ESTIMATE

DESIGN IX.

COUNTRY OR VILLAGE COTTAGE, COSTING $1,000.


This plan is designed to answer many requests for a “cosey and homelike
Cottage, suited to the wants of Mechanics and Laboring People, costing
from $700 to $1,000.” It is best adapted to a westward frontage—with the
hall, entrances, and porches protected from the north, but may be easily
adapted to an opposite frontage by reversing the plan—placing the hall,
etc., on the opposite side of the main house. The width, 21 feet, adapts
it to a 25-foot village lot, leaving a side passage to the rear....
EXTERIOR, (figs. 34 and 35.)—The _style_ of any building is determined by
the form of its roof; the steep and hooded style in this design accords
fully with domestic feelings and artistic sentiments, and is growing in
public favor for suburban structures. Compared with the usual _Mansard_
style is more practical, less expensive, and serves equally well. The
side-angles, porches, bay-window, cornices, and chimneys, each of simple
construction, make up a pleasing variety of parts. All superfluous
ornamentation is avoided. A too common fault prevails in villages, and
even in the country, of building close up to the street lines. A clear
depth of at least 20 feet in front should be devoted to a flower-garden,
shrubbery, and vines, for flowers are proper accessories of cottage
adornment, and architectural ornamentation can never compensate for
their absence.... CELLAR, (fig. 36.)—Hight of ceiling, 6½ feet. It
extends under the front half of the building, giving an average area of
11½ × 15 feet—quite sufficient for ordinary requirements. It has two
small front windows. A good ventilation may be had through the chimney;
openings in the rear foundation allow a circulation of air over the
unexcavated portion.... FIRST STORY, (fig. 37.)—Hight of ceiling, 9 feet;
is divided into a hall, parlor, living-room, rear entry, and a closet.
The Hall, entered from the front porch, connects through doors with the
parlor, living-room, and rear entry, and contains the main stairs. The
Parlor has a large bay-window in the front, opposite to which is a marble
shelf resting on stucco trusses. It communicates with the living-room
and hall. The remaining wall spaces are unbroken, for furniture and wall
ornaments. The Living-room is a little larger than the parlor, has two
windows, an open fireplace, a closet, and doors leading to the front
hall, parlor, and rear entry. The rear entry is under the platform of the
main stairs; is divided from the front hall, and is to be used as the
common entrance. It has doors leading from the front hall, living-room,
rear porch, and the cellar stairs. The parlor may be warmed by placing
a radiator under the marble shelf, and passing the smoke-pipe from the
living-room through it, as for Design III. The cost of such a radiator
is $6.... SECOND STORY, (fig. 38.)—Hight of center ceilings, seven feet;
hight of side-breast walls, 3½ feet. The stairs leading to this story
are made with a platform, placed three risers below the upper landing,
which allows for the required head-room. The divisions provide for four
rooms, a hall, and two closets; the large chamber has a double window
in front, a marble shelf on the chimney-breast, and a closet; the hall
bedroom is designed to be used in connection with the large chamber as
a child’s room.... CONSTRUCTION.—The excavation for the cellar is made
four feet deep, and for the rear foundation walls one foot. The loose
earth is graded around the foundation at completion, leaving 1½ feet of
the foundation exposed to sight on the outside. The foundation walls
are of broken stone, laid in common mortar, 16 inches thick, and neatly
pointed where exposed to sight, and are generally even with the framework
on the outside. Provision is made for the cellar stairway by extending
the adjoining walls beyond the inside of the frame to the hight of the
ground, and finishing above with brick-work. The chimney is started with
the cellar walls, and arranged with two continuous flues to the top.
Side-openings are made under the cap by inserting 6-inch earthen thimbles
on each side of the flues. The top courses of brick-work are laid across
the entire chimney, making a solid and more lasting cap. Sheet-iron
thimbles are put in the chimneys adjoining the parlor and front chamber.
The framing, inclosing, flooring, etc., are done in a substantial manner,
of materials indicated in the estimate below. Beams placed two feet apart
from centers; rafters and studding 16 inches apart. The cornice-trusses
are made of 2 × 4-inch timber, as shown in Design VI., and the shingling
and gutters in Design V. Sash, 1¼ inch thick, glazed with second quality
of French sheet-glass, counter-checked, and hung to iron balance-weights,
with good cord. Doors 4-paneled each, for the outside and rooms in first
story, and 1½ inches thick; all others 1¼ inches thick, moulded, with
double faces. The main stairs has a 7-inch octagon newel, a 2¼ × 4-inch
moulded rail, and 2-inch turned balusters, all of black walnut. The
side-walls and ceilings of the two full stories are white-sand finished,
on one coat of “laid-off” brown mortar. This is the favorite mode of
plastering through the Eastern States, while in the neighborhood of
New York two coats of brown mortar are usually applied. Where one-coat
work is properly done, more hair is mixed in the mortar, increasing its
strength. The _same quantity_ of mortar is used as for two coats. The
advantages claimed for the “one-coat work” are, a saving of one-third
in labor, and obviating the delay for the additional coat to dry. All
the wood-work usually painted, and the chimney-top, have two coats of
best American lead and _raw_ linseed-oil. For more extended remarks on
painting, see article with Design XII.

DESIGN X.

A HOUSE COSTING $1,100.


This economical cottage has ample, convenient apartments for a
medium-sized family, and is adapted to either a village or a more rural
location. A 25 × 100-feet lot will contain such a house, besides the
needed side alleyway to the rear. Those contemplating the erection of
low-priced, tasteful cottages in duplication, either for selling, or
by coöperation as in Building Associations, will find this plan suited
to their wants.... EXTERIOR, (fig. 39).—The front presents a graceful,
trim, outline, with a neat and pleasant arrangement of openings. The
Porch fits in an angle, with its steps projecting beyond the principal
building, providing an appropriate entrance to the house. The large
Bay-window is the most imposing feature of the front, is expressive of
comfort and cheerfulness, and gives a good appearance and character to
the whole building. The principal cornices are neatly trussed, and have
such “spread” as gives a finished and bold appearance to the roofs.
It has such proportions and genteel style, that if near a more formidable
or costly residence, it would not disgrace it.... CELLAR, (fig.
40.)—Hight 7 ft. Its outlines correspond with the ground-plans of the
principal building; it is three feet below the general surface of the
ground, and four feet above, and has an outside entrance door, three
good sized cellar windows, two of which are in the front, and one at
the side, contiguous to the coal-bin. It is accessible from the first
story by a plain stairway. If desirable at any time, a pleasant basement
room may be finished in the front part, at a small cost.... FIRST STORY,
(fig. 41).—Hight of ceilings, 9½ feet. It is divided into three rooms
of nearly equal size, with a Hall and two Closets. The Bay-window adds
considerable to its area, making it the largest and pleasantest room.
The Dining-room adjoins the parlor, and may be used with it as occasion
requires by opening the folding doors. Each of these rooms has neat
marble mantles, and opens into the front hall. The Kitchen connects with
the dining-room, and is provided with a pantry, pump, sink, two windows,
and an outside door leading to the rear yard. When houses are built on
single village lots, it is usual to arrange for one “blank” side, as
in this plan, but where more ground is allowed, it is desirable that
openings should be made for at least one window in each story of this
side, as they would add to the cheerfulness of the interior, and give
a better appearance to the outside. Two windows are thus indicated by
dotted lines, one for the dining-room, and one for the interior chamber,
though the latter is lighted from the roof, as noted. It may be advisable
even to put two other windows on this side of the house, for the outside
general good appearance, or blind-windows may be put in at small expense,
for the same purpose.... SECOND STORY, (fig. 42).—Ceilings 8 feet high.
The divisions are very simple, making four rooms, three closets, a
stairway, and passage leading to each room.... CONSTRUCTION.—Reference
is had in this plan to what is known in the trade as “piece-lumber”—the
joists, wall-strips, boards, etc., being generally in lengths of 13 feet
each. There is great economy in being able to use such standard lumber,
without cutting to waste. Figure 43 shows how a neat, cosey cottage-frame
may be cheaply constructed almost wholly of such 13-feet materials. But
there is a decided preference for full chamber ceilings, and as the
difference in cost would not exceed $60, it is best to make the house
_two full stories high_. The principal frame is of 3-inch timber, with
studding of 2 × 3 inch. This thickness of the frame-work secures some
220 feet more interior space to the rooms, than in the use of 4-inch
timber, besides saving one-fourth of its quantity and cost. Ordinary 1¼
× 10-inch spruce plank are used for the frame-work, for the floors and
ceilings. For the beams they are reduced to the depth of eight inches,
and the 2-inch strips sawed off are used for shingling-lath. For the
ceiling-frame of the second story, they are simply sawed through the
middle, leaving each half five inches deep, and are all placed 16 inches
apart from centers. One row of cross-bridging is put through the center
of each tier of beams, and the center of the ceiling-strips are secured
by hangers from the rafters. The Rafters are 2 × 4 inches, framed to rest
on the principal plates, where they are connected with the ceiling-strips
by spikes, preventing any settling or spreading of the roof. The Roof of
the main wing is constructed with double pitch, corresponding with that
of the main roof. The principal roofs are finished with shingles, and
has improved gutters, described in Design V. The porch and bay-window
roofs are covered with tin laid on smooth boarding.—The _rake_ or _pitch_
of roofs has much to do in giving character and finish to buildings.
For ordinary roofs, when shingles or slate are used, the rise should be
_one-third_ the width of the building, as in this case, the rise is 4⅓
feet, for the width of 13 feet. This pitch is very pleasant to the eye,
and easy of construction. In larger buildings, it is often desirable to
secure more space or head-room in the attic, when the rise should be
_one-half_ the width of the building. We would never go _between_ these
two angles in search of a roof-line that would gratify good taste, or
comport with any style, but deviations above one-half or below one-third
may be made, as circumstances indicate.—Circular openings covered with
blinds, in each gable, give free air circulation between the ceilings
and roof. Every dwelling should have some way of readily reaching the
roof from the inside to clean the gutters, repair the roof or chimneys,
and in case of fire in the house or in the neighborhood. An opening is
made in the ceiling of the middle chamber (fig. 42) over and just inside
the door, and thence through the roof. This is neatly boarded around
its sides, forming a “well,” and is covered at the top with a _sash_,
sloping with the roof, hung so as to be easily opened and closed by a
cord from the inside. This provides for light, ventilation, and a scuttle
in combination. A sash, hung on center pins to revolve, over the door of
this room, transmits light from the skylight to the second-story passage
and stairway, and supplies ventilation.... The mason’s work is complete
and substantial in every part. The foundation walls, piers, and chimneys,
are of hard brick and mortar; the plastering is two coats of brown mortar
and a hard finish.... HEATING.—Only two fires are required at any time
to make the principal rooms of this house comfortable. The parlor, and
chamber immediately above it, are warmed through a heater placed in a
parlor fire-place. The dining-room has a radiator fitted in the opening
of the mantel, and connected by 5-inch pipes through the fire-place back
with the kitchen stove.

DESIGN XI.

A HOUSE COSTING $1,600.


This plan is for a comfortable and genteel dwelling, suited to almost any
location, and for the accommodation of an averaged-sized family. Upwards
of twenty years’ experience in planning and building has taught me that
it is not difficult to design either as to Style, Room, or Cost, when
the owners have means sufficient to gratify their individual tastes, and
no special care is required to save expense. But it is quite another
matter to provide plans for the great mass of people who, through habit
or necessity, put everything to the test of economy, and to whom every
inch of room, or foot of material, is an important consideration. In
designing and projecting such work, theories avail little; practical
experience must then be the chief guide.... Conventional modes of living
have established a system of household arrangement and economy requiring
for every home of even moderate refinement, a house with a front hall, a
parlor, a dining-room, and a kitchen on the first floor, and a liberal
suite of chambers in a second story. Our plan herewith, though only 20
by 30 feet, provides for all the above. If built on an ordinary 25-feet
village lot, it will allow a needed passage-way on one side. In rapidly
filling up, crowded localities, four persons owning single lots, making
a frontage of 100 feet, can arrange together and build five houses on
this plan for about the cost of erecting four detached houses. The
fifth house may be rented or sold for the benefit of the four owners.
In such cases, a hall should be finished in the basement, with an
entrance in front similar to the one shown in the rear in fig. 45....
The FRONT ELEVATION is made up of simple parts, in a neat arrangement.
The Bay-window indicates refinement, and adds largely to the area or
room of the parlor.... The CELLAR walls are of hard brick, are 8 inches
thick, 7 feet high, and show at least 3 feet above ground. For health’s
sake alone, as well as for a better appearance, and for convenience, if
the basement should ever be desired finished off in rooms, which can be
done at any time with little expense, it is best to always place the
first floor well up from the ground. In very cold localities, frost
can be kept out of the basement by banking up in winter, or better by
laying the brick walls with an opening up through the center, extending
bricks across the opening at frequent intervals to secure firmness.
This central air-chamber promotes health, warmth, and dryness in the
basement or cellar. One foot of the soil taken from the excavation for
the cellar should be used in grading around the house, to secure the
flow of water _away_ from it, and still leave the walls three feet or
more above the ground.... FIRST STORY, (fig. 46).—Hight of ceiling, 9½
feet. The divisions embrace three rooms, a hall, and two closets. Double
doors are provided for the front entrance, and between the parlor and
dining-room, and marble mantles and shelves in the principal rooms.
A movable “Dresser” having drawers and shelving with small doors, is
indicated for the dining-room. This room may be heated by leading a
pipe from the kitchen stove to a drum and back into the chimney, or up
through the chamber above to warm that somewhat. A “Fireplace heater” in
the parlor will warm the chamber above.... SECOND STORY, (fig. 47.)—The
hight of the ceilings are 8½ feet. There are four chambers, with closets
to each, and a small hall. The head-room over the main stairs extends
beneath the closet to the inner edge of the shelf shown—the floor in
these parts being angled to suit the pitch of the stairs.... REMARKS
on construction.—An end section of the “Novelty siding” is shown in
fig. 48. This is of 10-inch boards, 1 inch thick, cut as shown in the
engraving. The groove in the center gives it the appearance of narrow
clapboards; the lap of about an inch closes tightly, and the thick boards
not only add to the warmth, but also to the strength. A house covered
with this will vibrate very little in the most windy situations, and be
firmer than one covered with thin siding having much heavier timber.
Where planing mills are accessible, it is little more expensive than the
dressed half-inch boarding, and the appearance is quite as pretty. In
this vicinity it is customary to purchase a lot of pretty good quality
merchantable pine boards, select the best and clearest of knots for
siding, and use the rest for flooring where knots are not objectionable
when to be covered with carpeting. The smaller and firm knots in the
siding used, are readily covered with paint, if first primed with a
little solution of shellac in alcohol. A section of the wall is shown
in fig. 49. The studding, 2 × 4, makes a space of four inches between
the siding and plastering. Tarred paper, or what is termed roofing-felt,
is procured in rolls 32 inches wide. A saw run through the roll cuts it
into 16-inch strips. The studs being set 16 inches apart from center
to center, leaves the clear space of 14 inches. The strips of felt are
turned up an inch on each edge, and these turned edges are held against
the studs by lath firmly up and down, so as to hold the sheets midway
between the plastering and siding. This leaves _two_ air-chambers, both
good non-conductors of heat. Mice or insects will not eat or go through
this material. It is impervious to currents of air, and the whole is as
warm as if filled in with brick. The cost is very small, and, as will be
readily seen, it is much warmer than when the felt is put on directly
under the boards, leaving only one air-chamber, and that a wide one....
In all house-plans, we advise putting in all the closets possible; they
are always convenient, even a foot square “cubby-hole” in the side
of a chimney is a handy place. In planning a house, after making the
size as large as one’s means will allow, the “better half” should be
consulted as to the advisability of making this or that room a little
smaller by cutting off a few inches here and there to enlarge a pantry
or closet.... We always advise to put in an extra bell or two, and one
or more speaking-tubes, to connect the upper and lower rooms. The cost
is but trifling, if they are put in when building. A hundred feet of
speaking-tube will cost but $2 or $3; the carpenter can insert it behind
the lath, running it from one room to another in a few minutes, and it
will save many steps, and much calling through the halls, especially when
the mother happens to be an invalid, and restrained to a chamber.... In
arranging sink, table, dish-pantry, etc., with reference to dining-room
and kitchen, always plan to save steps. A distance of 10 feet extra,
traveled over each way, say 20 times a day, in handling food and dishes,
amounts to 28 miles extra walking every year, all of which may be saved
by a slight change in arrangement. These are small matters, but these
have much to do in making a “convenient house.”

general character of the work. The prices given are for materials in
the vicinity of New York. Carpenters wages are reckoned at $2 per day;
mason’s work, $2.50 per day; and painters, $3 per day:

Prices vary in different localities, somewhat, but when higher in some
particulars, they will generally be lower in others, so that the whole
cost will not be greatly different over a considerable extent of country.
There are many items that can be cut down in the above estimate, where
great economy is needful. For example, substitute wood for stone steps
and sills; omit the blinds and bay-windows, use cheaper doors, pine-stair
railing and newel, instead of walnut, etc. Our estimate is for a pretty,
complete, tasteful house.

DESIGN XII.

A HOUSE COSTING $1,700.


The plans here given are similar in many respects to Design XI., and
are somewhat larger, but can be built for very nearly the same cost....
ELEVATION, (fig. 50).—The front is irregular, having an angle, which
narrows the parts, supplies more vertical lines, and adds to their
length comparatively. These are important features, imparting a graceful
appearance, and influencing the entire character of the house.... The
angle affords ample room for the piazza, which can be built for much
less cost than when its three sides are exposed. The next attractive
features of the front are the bay-windows below, and double windows
above, with the balustrade and hood so proportioned and arranged that
they conform with each other with pleasing effect.... CELLAR, (fig.
51).—The Foundation Walls are of hard brick laid in mortar, 8 inches
thick, and 7 feet high. In localities where the foundation rests on loose
sand, care should be taken to provide a bedding, laid 4 inches below
the cellar bottom, 16 inches wide, of brick, or better, of large flat
stones. Still greater care should be bestowed on the bedding for the
chimneys and girder supports, for they sustain the greatest proportionate
weight, and any settlement of these parts will cause a depression of
the floors, disarranging the whole house, and become an immediate and
continuous source of anxiety and expense. The Area in the rear is built
of hard brick and mortar, with blue-stone steps and coping. Blue-stone
sills are provided for each of the cellar windows.... FIRST STORY, (fig.
52.)—The interior arrangement of the plan will be appreciated as making
the best possible use of the room. The Front Hall is wider than is usual
in houses of this character. The Stairs are arranged with the “quarter
circle” about midway of their hight, which brings the niche down where
it becomes an important feature of the hall. The three principal rooms,
the parlor, dining-room, and kitchen, can be entered from the hall. The
latter two rooms have doors leading to the lobby. The Lobby is built of
4½-inch tongued and grooved ceiling-boards, with sashes made to swing.
A Shelf, 1½ feet high, and another just above the sash, give sufficient
frame-work to fasten the center of the boarding; the ends are nailed
to the sill and plate; these shelves will be found useful for many
purposes. Attached to the lobby, and built with it, is a good-sized
Pantry (_P_), for the dining-room. The Kitchen is provided with a closet
at the side of the chimney, a sink, with small closet underneath, and
a direct communication to the cellar stairs under the hall stairs. The
window in the side of the dining-room may be omitted, if the house is
in a village and joins another, but this is desirable to give abundant
light in this, which is really the living-room of the family.—The method
of heating indicated in Design XI. is applicable to this plan.... SECOND
STORY, (fig. 53.)—The peculiar manner of constructing the Stairs brings
their landing nearly in the center, so that hall space sufficient only
for four doors is necessary, leaving almost the entire floor to be laid
off into rooms. The heavy lines show the most simple method of dividing
this story into four rooms. Should another room be desirable, it can be
taken off from two rooms, as shown by the dotted lines. In this case,
another window may be inserted as indicated. Every one’s experience will
suggest that there can not be too many closets, and we have added one to
every room in the house, except the parlor.... CONSTRUCTION.—The bill of
timber appended indicates a “regular” _Frame_. It is a great satisfaction
and saving to have the timber properly “laid out,” and framed by, and
under the immediate direction of a master mechanic, so as to be quickly
and substantially raised. Four good carpenters would easily frame all
the timber in this house in two days, and raise it the next day. At
least one man of well-known ability and experience as a mechanic should
be with and take charge of those employed to build a house. It is not
economical for one about to build a _home_ to trust such work to the
caprice of an inexperienced man, who has “helped” around some job, until
he has learned the name of tools, but who has no positive knowledge of
the trade, and could not for his life “lay out” the corner-post for a
two-story house, yet is shrewd enough to screen his deficiencies by
suggesting “balloon,” or something indefinite, that requires little or no
skill. It sometimes happens, in localities remote from large cities or
large towns, that persons are obliged to do with make-shifts, to get a
home at all. It was such a condition of things that led the well-disposed
pioneer of the West to adopt the method called “Balloon framing,” which
is really no framing at all, and required no skill to get up a kind of
home acceptable under such circumstances. But wherever skilled labor
may be had, it is ridiculous to see a gang of intelligent(?) mechanics
standing up pieces of diverse lengths, and propping them in a vertical
position with rods running every way as braces, not one of which can be
removed until the upper ends are secured by ties of some sort. A good
frame in a house is equivalent to a good constitution in a man, and is
of vital importance; it need not be clumsy or overloaded, but should
at least have the merit of being able to stand alone.... PAINTING.—The
principal object in Painting should be to protect and preserve the
materials used in construction, as also to give a good appearance.
All exterior wood-work, though executed with the greatest care and in
the most substantial manner, if left exposed to climatic influences,
is very soon destroyed. It is economy to use only the _best lead_ and
_linseed-oil_ in painting exterior wood-work. They will outlast all other
compounds, present a better appearance, and in the end furnish a much
better foundation for future painting. The difference in cost between the
best materials and the imitations, for painting the exterior of a house
built on these plans, would not exceed $12, and the cost of labor would
be just the same in either case. The first coat or “priming,” should be
put on with the greatest care, so as to thoroughly cover and close all
the pores in the exposed surface. All window and outside door frames,
corner-boards, window-caps, water-table, and stoop-flooring, should be
primed _before_ setting, especially their edges, where joinings require
to be made, as it will be the last opportunity to do justice to these
parts, where moisture is liable to collect and remain. When priming is
well done, it is best to let the building stand until thoroughly dried,
both inside and out, before adding the second coat. It must be evident
to any one that much of the water used in the plastering must percolate
through, and thoroughly saturate every part of a house. Sufficient time
should be allowed for this moisture to pass off, and the whole house to
become dried out.... The nails should then be “set,” which will tighten
up permanently all the laps in the siding, after which the work should
be properly puttied, and the second coat applied. Autumn is the best
season to paint, after the extreme heat has passed, and insects have
disappeared; the process of drying will be slower and more perfect, with
less waste by evaporation, leaving a smooth, solid surface. I am often
asked “_what color to paint?_” Notwithstanding much has been said against
white for outside painting, and realizing that there are many cases
where white would not be suitable, or thought of, yet I believe that for
suitability and good taste, in nine cases out of ten, very light colors,
or pure white, are indicated. I have known instances where much time has
been spent to discover a suitable color for a house, where nearly all the
different pigments were drawn from, and after much mixing and testing,
the result has generally been an unknown and unnamed shade, as if
everything depended on some sentimental “blending with the background,”
or in other words, painting the house out of sight. As a rule, paint so
as to best reveal the true character of the building, and this is best
done when the colors afford the foundation for the natural shadows that
result from the true and actual projections. For the body and trimmings
are suggested a light “Dorchester” gray; roofs, graphite-black; sash,
coach-black; blinds, “chocolate.”

DESIGN XIII.

FRENCH-ROOFED COTTAGE, COSTING $2,000.


These plans were designed for a genteel cottage adapted to
thickly-settled localities, where the increased value of lands make
it necessary to reduce the area, and build upwards. Several houses
constructed from these plans in this vicinity are admired for their
convenient accommodation and cheerfulness.... EXTERIOR, (fig. 54.)—The
Foundation extends four feet above ground, giving a desirable altitude
to the whole building. The front is enlivened by the numerous window
and door openings, the several projections of piazza, dormers, and
cornices, and the variety of the materials used. The dressing of the
several parts are of simple designs. The projections of cornices, etc.,
should always be self-sustaining, yet while this is true, there is sure
to be a fancied necessity for some apparent support obvious from the
outside. Such supports require special treatment, with a view to their
proper form and proportion, and should be sparingly applied, giving to
each one its distinct place and purpose. Brackets of neat pattern are
often crowded so closely together as to cheapen and destroy their beauty,
and overload the cornice, thus reversing their legitimate purpose as
supports.... CELLAR, (fig. 55.)—Hight of ceiling 7 feet; it extends under
the main house only. Its hight above the ground gives an opportunity for
good-sized window openings. If desired at any time, an airy and light
work-room or laundry can be made by dividing and flooring a part of this
story at little cost.... FIRST STORY, (fig. 56).—Hight of ceiling 10
feet. It has a hall running through the whole length of the main house,
with entrances from both front and rear. The parlor, dining-room, and
kitchen, are all good-sized apartments, and pleasantly arranged. Double
folding doors are provided for the front entrances and from the hall
to the parlor, and sliding doors between the parlor and dining-room. A
bay-window adds materially to the size and pleasantness of the dining or
living-room. Each room has an open fire-place; the kitchen has a pump and
sink, with the usual supply and waste pipe connections. The rear stoop
is roofed, and has a portable enclosure of light ceiling boards, to be
used in severe weather.... SECOND STORY, (fig. 57.)—Hight of ceiling 8½
feet. The divisions of this story are simple—giving a hall, two large
chambers, with passage between, two hall rooms, and two closets....
CONSTRUCTION.—The estimate given provides for foundation of broken stone,
laid and neatly pointed with good mortar; the stone exposed to sight on
the outside to be “semi-dressed.” Blue-stone, or other suitable stone
obtained most readily, are used for the sills of cellar windows, for the
steps, and wall coping of the cellar entrance. The principal timber is
of seasoned spruce or pine, thoroughly framed, raised, and secured. The
“framing-in” of braces is too frequently omitted—cutting them “barefoot,”
and spiking, being substituted. The latter does very well where the frame
is strongly sheathed over, and the outer siding applied afterwards. The
sheathing aids largely in stiffening the frame, but should not be relied
on to the exclusion of the necessary braces to square up the frame, and
prevent the swaying which often happens unobserved, to be discovered
when too late to remedy it. Laxity in the matter of bracing has led to
frequent errors as to their proper place in the frame. When framed in
they are invariably placed in the _upper angles_ under the ties and
plates, adjoining the posts, and when barefoot they should be put in
the same angles; never, as is frequently done for convenience, in the
lower angles, nor on the sills. A moment’s reflection will convince any
one that _if the right angles along the principal frame are rigidly
maintained, displacements will never occur_, except, as rarely happens,
the whole is bodily raised from the foundation by a hurricane. The most
_reliable_ angles are those formed by the tie and post connections,
because at these points the posts are tenoned and mortised together,
and secured with hard wood pins. Those least reliable are at the foot
of the posts, adjoining the sills, where their connections are secured
only by the weight of the upper frame. Braces placed in the latter angles
serve only as fulcrums to endanger the frames when tested by ordinary
winds; but if the former or _upper_ angles are made positive, by having
substantial braces in them, the severest gales may be defied. The siding
is of narrow, clear pine clapboards, laid on “thicknessed” sheathing.
The Mansard part of the main roof is covered by 8 × 16-inch slate—the
piazza, bay-window, kitchen, stoop, cornices, window, and deck roof with
IC. charcoal tin—all laid on hemlock boards. Tarred felting is spread
under all siding and slate. The first and second stories are fully
completed inside; the attic is floored, but otherwise unfinished, but may
be divided at any time into rooms as shown for the second story (fig.
57). The interior plastering is three-coat work, on seasoned lath. All
sash are four lights, and hung to balance-weights. Blinds are properly
hung (outside) to each window. All wood, tin, and brick-work, usually
painted, has two coats of best lead and oil-paint, with stainers to suit
the owner’s taste. The choice of colors for the exterior is frequently
canvassed during the construction of these buildings; often some person
of _taste_ (?) decides by “warming”—adding red and yellow, until, by the
preponderance of these stainers, the most sombre and dismal colors are
produced. The most appropriate and pleasing shade for the body of this
class of house is a _light gray_; for the trimmings, _dark gray_; for
the sash, _burnt sienna_; for the blinds, _chocolate_. The tin roofing
should match the _slate_ in color. Red colors should be sparingly used,
or omitted altogether.

DESIGN XIV.

A FRENCH-ROOFED COTTAGE COSTING $2,000.


These plans were designed for a cottage recently built by Mr. W. W.
Billings, in New London, Conn. These sketches embrace also the outlines
of the grounds immediately surrounding. The site faces a street having
steep grades, conforming to the general declivity upon which a large
part of the city is built. The grounds are raised above the sidewalk,
and leveled in front, and are faced with stone-work from 2½ feet high
at left, to 6 feet high at the right. The rear grounds are 6 feet
higher than those in front. The step _A_, at the entrance (see fig.
59), is 8 inches above the sidewalk. _B_ is the bottom of the cellar,
2 feet 2 inches higher than _A_, and is solid rock. The walk leading
from _A_ to the rear ascends 1¼ inch to the foot; the banks at either
side are terraced, and have stone steps inserted in them leading to
the flagging at the foot of the porch steps, and also to the area, or
cellar entrance.... ELEVATION, (fig. 58.)—The French roof style is well
adapted to this situation on account of its rounded and solid appearance.
The irregularities of outline secure agreeable features of variety and
picturesqueness. The Foundation shows 4 feet above ground in front,
and 1 foot in the rear. The Porch is in an angle, and the second story
extending over it is carried up vertically past the slated part of the
main roof, forming a tower-like corner. This corner is largely supported
by a single column, and to make it as light as possible, slating of this
portion is omitted.—(_As usually laid, slate weighs 500 lbs.; tin, 50
lbs. per square._).... CELLAR, (fig. 59.)—Hight is 6½ feet. Four windows
are placed where they give light to every part. An outside door opens
to the area, the latter being covered by the front porch. The front
portion of this cellar can easily be finished off for a work-room or
summer kitchen.... FIRST STORY, (fig. 60.)—Hight of ceiling 10 feet. The
arrangements are convenient, comprising a hall, parlor, dining-room,
and kitchen. The main entrance leads from the right of the porch, and
the hall runs parallel with the front. Many persons prefer the entrance
arranged in this way, as the contents of the hall are not exposed to
the street whenever the doors are opened or left ajar. A partition
crosses the hall under the platform, adjoining the cylinder, forming
a rear passage leading from the kitchen to the cellar stairs. The
Parlor has a large bay-window in front, with a marble mantle directly
opposite. The Dining-Room and Kitchen each have windows giving views
in three directions. The small wing at the rear contains a good-sized
pantry, closet, and the rear entrance or lobby.... SECOND STORY, (fig.
61.)—Hight of ceiling 9 feet. The divisions include a hall, three large
chambers, a bedroom, and three closets. All parts are well lighted.
Ventilating Registers are placed in the center of each chamber ceiling.
The space above this ceiling under the tin roof is ventilated through
8-inch pipes inserted in opposite sides of the roof. These pipes have
funnel-shaped covers, elevated two inches above the upper end of the
pipes.... CONSTRUCTION.—The Foundation Walls are of semi-dressed stone.
The Chimneys are of hard brick, the cellar portions are constructed with
a hollow space or ash-pit, arranged to receive the ashes from the fires
of the first story. The siding is beveled clap-boards, laid on sheathing
felt. The mansard parts of the main roof are covered with 8 × 16-inch
Keystone slate laid on felt. All other roofs are of IC. charcoal tin, all
laid on seasoned boards. The two full stories are hard finished upon two
coats of brown mortar. All parts usually painted have two coats of paint,
of material and shades to suit the owner. For suggestions on selecting
colors or shades see Design XIII.—ESTIMATE cost of materials and labor:

DESIGN XV.

A SOUTHERN HOUSE COSTING $2,000.


These plans, designed for a Georgia residence, will be adapted to the
requirements of others desiring to build an inexpensive rural home in
any of the Southern States.... EXTERIOR, (fig. 62.)—The plan indicates
that the proprietor is not circumscribed by want of land, and prefers to
extend the area of the ground floor, rather than to build upward. The
breadth of the front (48 feet), the large entrance and window openings,
the spacious verandas, and broad steps, are each prominent and desirable
features, indicative of comforts and hospitality. The elevated, or
second story part of the Main House, forms a substantial and fitting
center, around which the roofs of the wings and verandas incline, and
adds largely in giving poise and character to the whole building. The
hight from the earth grades to the frame-work of the building is 2 feet.
Its location should have a good surface drainage assured during rainy
seasons, and afford pleasant outlooks from the verandas.... INTERIOR.—In
most parts of the South, very much of the year could be a latitude
comfortably spent out of doors altogether, but for the requirements of
shade and retirement. There are times, however, when severe weather makes
it necessary that one’s family should be well housed, and when a good
fire is both a luxury and necessity. A house for such should have large
rooms, with high ceilings, an abundance of door and window openings, and
a plentiful spread of shady verandas. Where practicable, the windows
should have folding sashes opening to the floor, if protected by outside
coverings. There should be at least one chimney in the main or highest
part of the house, having a large open fire-place adapted to the use
of wood for fuel, and having openings near the room ceilings into the
flues, for ventilation. The Dining-room, Kitchen, and the more domestic
offices, require a separate and distinct building, situated a short
distance in the rear of the house, and connected with it by a covered
passage-way.... FIRST STORY, (fig. 63.)—Hight of ceiling 10 feet. The
simple arrangement shown provides for each of the above requirements. The
front Entrance is through large double doors. The Hall extends through
the house. The Living-room, a large apartment adapted to a good-sized
family, is centrally situated, and protected on every side from the
direct rays of the sun; it adjoins the pleasant and shady verandas front
and rear, both being accessible through the folding windows, that open
like doors down to the floor. It communicates with the hall through
wide double doors, has a large closet and an open fire. The Bedroom is
of good dimensions, has three windows opening to the verandas, and one
side window. The two closets are so arranged as to form an alcove to
the rear window. The ceiling of this alcove is arched over, producing a
very pleasant effect. An opening is made near the ceiling into one of
the flues of the adjoining chimney for ceiling ventilation. The Parlor
(or Library) is situated in the most quiet part of the building, where
company may be entertained, or persons may engage in reading or study,
without disturbance from those engaged in housework. Large windows open
to the front veranda, and other windows are provided at the side and
rear. A covered Passage-way leads from the rear hall door to the food
departments. These consist of a Dining-room, Kitchen, Store-room, and
two Closets, and to the rear of these is added a servant’s Bedroom. The
dining-room and kitchen are each of ample size, with windows arranged
on opposite sides to admit a plentiful supply of fresh air. A pump,
sink, and two wash-tubs are provided in the kitchen. The store-room and
closets are thoroughly shelved. If desirable, a china closet may be
easily constructed at one side of the fire-place, into which one of the
doors already provided would open.... SECOND STORY, (fig. 64.)—Hight of
ceiling 9 feet. This may be divided into two or more rooms, as required,
for bedrooms. The cross-partitions may be 8 feet high, admitting a free
passage of air above them.... CONSTRUCTION.—Brick piers, placed 6 feet
apart under all sills, are intended for the foundation. The remaining
space is left unobstructed for the circulation of air. A cellar may be
excavated, and walled up under the main house, with stairs leading to it
from the rear veranda, under the main flight. In the estimate, provision
is made for a regular frame of sawed timber, which should be framed and
raised in a substantial manner. The siding for the main house and wings
is of 6-inch pine clap-boards, laid 5 inches to the weather. The roofs of
the main house and wings are laid with hemlock boards; all other roofs
and cornice projections are laid with inverted 1 × 4½-inch tongued and
grooved pine flooring, and lastly covered with IC. charcoal tin, locked
and soldered in the best manner. The cornices are constructed with wide
projections, and have neat truss supports. The verandas are made with
simple parts. The columns for the front are 7-inch boxed, with bases, and
scrolled spandrels; for the rear of 3 × 4 joist with bases, and plain
spandrels. The veranda plates and rafters are dressed for painting, and
are left exposed to sight. The pediments shown on the front are of open
work, to allow the warmed air from near the roofs to escape. The upper
frame-work (plates and rafters) of the rear building are also planed,
and left exposed to sight from the inside. The inclosing and partitions
for this part are of 1 × 4½-inch pine tongued and grooved flooring,
dressed on both sides, put on in a vertical manner, and nailed to the
sills and plates; 1¼-inch pine battens are put around the inside of the
rooms at the proper hight for a chair-rail (2¾ feet to the upper edge),
and joined to the casings of the doors and windows of like materials,
and all thoroughly nailed with “clinch” nails to the upright boarding.
The roof is built as described for the verandas, is double pitch, and
has sufficient spread to include the shed, making it a part of the same
building. The kitchen chimney is built nearly in the center of this
building, has a large open fire-place, and has a good hight above the
roof. All floors are of 1 × 4½-inch tongued and grooved pine flooring,
close laid and blind nailed. All rooms in the main building and wings are
hard-finished upon two coats of brown mortar. All work usually painted
has two coats of good paint. The roof-gutters are made as shown in Design
V.... ESTIMATE:

DESIGN XVI.

A HOUSE COSTING $2,100.


This plan, embodying the principal characteristics of a design I made
several years ago, for the residence of Mr. Arthur Waller, Newtown, L.
I., has a homelike, tasteful, and picturesque appearance—particularly
now, with its neatly laid-out grounds and grown up shrubbery, which
especially befit its _pointed style_, and demonstrate the harmony that
exists between these simple _cottage_ outlines, and rural surroundings.
It is thus adapted to either a suburban or more retired country
situation.... ELEVATION, (fig. 65.)—A noticeable peculiarity is the earth
finish around the foundation, which is simply utilizing the earth from
the cellar. This is banked against the foundation, up to within six
inches of the wood, evenly graded at 45 degrees angle, and neatly covered
with closely laid turf. This conceals a roughly constructed foundation;
it insures more dryness of the cellar, and consequently of the whole
house; it guards the cellar against extreme heat in summer, and frost in
winter; and it gives such a visible breadth of bottom as to add to its
apparent strength. This earth finish around the foundation is especially
adapted to wet or clayey soils, where it is desirable to have the cellar
mostly above ground; at the same time it secures greater elevation to
the whole building.... There are marked features of dissimilarity in the
several openings, and in the details of the exterior dressing, each part
being adapted to its special purpose, and so arranged as to be in keeping
with the general design; it therefore unites harmony and beauty....
CELLAR, (fig. 66.)—The Cellar extends under the whole house; clear hight
6½ feet. The outside entrance to the cellar is by an area-way, having
stone steps and walls, with hatchway and inside doors; the hatchway
doors, when closed, being even with the sloping earth finish.... FIRST
STORY, (fig. 67.)—Hight of ceiling 9½ feet. The irregular outlines of
this plan contribute to the cheerfulness of the different apartments,
by giving opportunity for the insertion of windows where they will
command the most pleasing prospects. The principal entrance is from
the porch through double doors to the spacious hall, which adjoins the
parlor and dining-room. The Parlor has one bay and two plain windows,
with large wall space for furniture and wall decoration. The Dining-room
is conveniently arranged to connect with the principal hall, parlor,
rear lobby, large pantry, or closet, and the cellar stairway, and has a
large bay and one plain window. The Kitchen is planned to have a range,
sink, pump, wash-tubs, and the usual pipes for cold and hot water, and
is provided with two windows, situated in opposite sides of the room to
give abundant light, and afford thorough ventilation; a closet adjoins
the chimney-breast, and a cupboard is put beneath the sink. The Pantry
is of good dimensions, contiguous to both dining-room and kitchen, has
a suitable window, and is furnished with shelving. The rear entrance is
from the covered stoop to the rear lobby, and from thence to either
dining-room or kitchen.... SECOND STORY, (fig. 68.)—This story is
reached by a winding stairway from the principal hall, and contains four
good-sized chambers, a bath-room, five large closets, and the needed
passage-ways. The breast-walls are vertical to the hight of 3½ feet, and
are continued upward along the underside of the steep roof frame-work
to the ceiling, which is 8 feet high. The Bath-room is provided with a
bath-tub and seat-closet. The Tank is 1 foot 8 in. wide, 2 feet long, and
3 feet deep, and is placed in the closet adjoining the bath-room, at a
hight of 2 feet above the floor, and provided with a neat-fitting lid.
The spaces above and below the tank may be used as a closet for toweling,
etc. The _interior location_ of this tank should insure it against frost,
so long as the house is occupied by the family.... CONSTRUCTION.—The
excavations for the cellar are 2 feet deep, and the earth is used as
above described. The materials for the principal foundations may be of
the roughest stone, such as are commonly used in farm-fencing, and coarse
mortar. Very little skill is required in the construction of these walls,
as only the last, or top course, is seen from the outside, which should
be laid to a line, and levelled to receive the frame-work. The exposed
portions of the bay-window foundations are constructed of brick laid in
mortar, resting on stone-work, and leaving an interior recess or shelf,
as shown on the cellar plan. The cellar windows are of good dimensions,
and situated where they will insure sufficient light, and provide for
the complete airing of the cellar. An opening should be left in one, or
both of the chimneys, near the cellar ceiling, having a continuous flue
to the top, which will be heated by contact with the fire-places above
when in use, and produce a draft that will exhaust the poisonous vapors
always generated in cellars, and prevent them from rising through the
house to contaminate the air of the living-rooms. This cellar may be
easily and cheaply divided into separate apartments by rough planking or
otherwise, if ever desirable. The rear portion might be readily converted
into a laundry, where the wash-tubs, with their accompanying pipes, might
be placed, leaving more kitchen room, and relieving it of the steam and
general disturbance of the ever-recurring washing days. Large durable
posts are placed in the cellar, resting on large flat stones that have
been embedded in the cellar bottom, as supports for the 4 × 8-inch
girders, shown on the cellar plan by the dotted lines. By the estimate,
it will be seen that very little timber is used in the frame-work, of
which the sills and beams comprise the heavier parts. I would enforce
the importance of having the frame fitted and secured together in
a substantial manner. The beams should be bridged as described for
Design XVII.... The exterior sides of the frame-work are designed to be
inclosed with double boarding, with an intermediate lining of tarred
felting. The first covering should be milled to even thicknesses, and
put on horizontally and double nailed to each stud. The felting is next
applied in whole width strips, running from the sill to the plate. The
water-table and window-frames are next put in their places, after which
the final covering of tongued and grooved sheathing is put on vertically,
with the lower ends neatly fitted to the water-table, and the upper ends
covered with a 10-inch board forming a frieze to the cornice. The siding
should then be painted one coat in a thorough manner, when battens of 1½
inch “half round” (previously painted both sides) are firmly nailed over
the joints of the sheathing. The windows are all arranged for 1½-inch
sash, hung to iron weights with good cord, and neatly cased and moulded
on the inside; outside blinds are intended for each window above the
cellar. The cornices are constructed in the simplest manner, and the
perforated barges and finials are made as indicated by the elevation, and
placed near the extremity of the gable cornices, from which ever-varying
shadows are made against the building, producing the most delicate
and pleasing effects. It is purposely intended that the roofs of the
principal building, porch, stoop, bay, and dormer windows, shall have
sufficient pitch for shingling.... The character of the balance of the
work may be inferred from the estimate which is given in detail.—ESTIMATE:

DESIGN XVII.

A HOUSE COSTING $2,200.


These plans are for a full two-story house, that will embrace the
merits of the most economical form of construction (having a floor
measurement of 24 × 28, nearly square), with symmetry of style, and
containing a very commodious and convenient interior arrangement. The
ELEVATION (fig. 69), has marked features of simplicity and refinement,
with sufficient diversity of parts to give variety and grace, without
pretentious display. We invariably recommend high foundations for
houses of this character; of course a foot in hight at the bottom will
add a foot to the hight of the whole, imparting a better appearance
externally, and on account of the better ventilation thereby afforded
to the cellar, adds greatly to the healthfulness of the interior of
the whole house. Additional steps will be required to the stoops, but
the cost of these are compensated by deductions in the excavation for
the cellar, and stone steps to the area. The large porch and double
doors, the bay and other windows, each distinctive in themselves, and
adapted to their places, similar only in conformity of character, are so
proportioned as to harmonize with each other with pleasing effect. The
pediments of the roof are so arranged that each “face” of the building
will have very nearly the same appearance of outline. The main cornice
projects two feet beyond the frame-work of the house, and is supported
by large trusses; all other cornices and window-caps have proportionate
projections, insuring heavy shadows, giving relief and finish to the
whole.... CELLAR, (fig. 70.)—Excavations for this cellar are made 2 feet
6 inches below the general surface of the ground. The Foundation-walls,
Chimneys, Girder-supports, and rear Area-walls are built as described
for Design XII., after which the earth is graded around, and up against
the foundation, so as to give such slope as will turn the water away
from the house and walks, leaving the foundation 4 feet above the final
grade.... FIRST STORY, (fig. 71.)—This story contains the principal
hall, parlor, dining or living-room, kitchen, rear lobby, three closets,
and private stairs. The principal Hall is entered from the front porch,
through large double doors, is square (10 × 10 feet), and contains the
principal stairs, which are built with a quarter circle and niche nearly
in the center of their hight, as described in Design XII. This hall
connects with the parlor through double doors; this will be found to give
an impression of amplitude that would scarcely be expected in a house of
this size. The Parlor has a large bay-window, finished with elliptical
arch and ornamental corbels, and a marble mantle. The Dining-room is
intended as the living-room of the family, and communicates with each
room and hall of the first story; has a closet under the front stairs,
and has a marble mantle. The Kitchen is provided with a large range,
two closets, sink, with cold and hot water, and closet underneath, and
communicates with the dining-room, lobby, and cellar stairway. The
rear entrance to this story is through the lobby, which has two small
windows. The private stairs are arranged to start from the rear lobby....
SECOND STORY, (fig. 72.)—The manner in which this story is divided into
rooms very much resemble a “double” house, the hall being nearly in
the center of the house, and the rooms at either side: contains hall,
two stairways, six rooms, and five closets. The hall is 5 ft. 6 in. ×
10 ft., and has seven doors leading from it to the different rooms and
private stairway. Many persons require a “study”; the room directly
above the principal hall is best adapted for such purpose, has a large
closet, and is most convenient to the stairs. The door to this room
should have ground glass upper panels, to admit light to the hall. The
Bath-room is provided with French bath-tub, seat-closet, and wash-basin.
The soil-pipe from this story will be concealed by passing down inside
one of the kitchen closets. Marble shelves, resting on stucco trusses,
are intended for each of the four principal rooms of this story....
GENERAL DETAILS.—It is intended that all the work should be done in a
workmanlike and substantial manner, of good materials, as indicated in
the estimate. All the principal timber is framed together, and raised in
the usual manner, and secured with hard-wood pins. The enclosing should
be dressed, of thoroughly seasoned materials, and nailed with 10_d._
nails. The cornices are ornamented with bold panelled brackets and dentil
courses. Each gable is provided with a circular ventilator. All roofs
are covered with charcoal tin, laid on rough boards, and have gutters
as described for Design V., at a cost of 10 cts. per running foot. The
columns of the front porch are turned, and have ornamental caps and
square pedestals. The stoop-rail is 5 inches wide, and the balusters are
scroll-sawed, of 1½-inch pine plank. The trusses under the bay-window are
large, scroll-sawed, and ornamental. The flooring should be thoroughly
dried, close-laid, and double-nailed to each beam with 10_d._ nails.
While laying the floor (having reached the center of the span of the
beams), a row of cross-bridging should be put in, in a strong manner.
In this way, the _inequalities_ of the upper surfaces of the beams,
which are always more or less sprung, will be brought _into line_ by the
flooring, and each piece of bridging will receive its relative proportion
of the weight. The tarred paper is next inserted between the outside
studding, in the manner described for Design XI., which is much cheaper
than “brick-filling,” and for many reasons more desirable. The central
partitions, that carry the principal weight, should be studded strongly
of 4-inch materials, or wall-strips set edgeways. All closet, stair,
and cross partitions may be set of 2-inch materials, or wall-strips set
flatways. This latter method saves nearly one-half of the space taken
by the partitions, which may be added to the size of the rooms, where
it frequently happens that a few inches becomes a matter of importance.
The second-story ceiling timbers are of wall-strips, put 12 inches from
centers, and a flooring of rough boards is laid over a part, to make room
for storage, etc. All sash are 1½ inches thick, and have second quality
French glass in them, and are hung with iron weights. We think there is
a good opportunity for improvement in the manufacture of window sashes,
making them air-tight, and suggest inserting the necessary rubber strips
near their edges, and especially in the lips of the check-rail—this
would effectually shut out all drafts of air, and make the unsightly
and impracticable “weather-strip” unnecessary. All stairs should have
1¼ strings and treads, and ⅞ risers, and should be so housed, glued,
and keyed, as to make them solid; squeaky stairs are abominable, and
even when assured of their safety, one feels an instinctive suspicion of
danger, and will look for treachery in every part of the house. Black
walnut panelled newel, moulded rail, and fluted balusters, are intended
for the principal flight of stairs. Setting the niche is a part of the
stair-builder’s work, and should always be included in his estimate
for stairs of this character. The trimming of the hall, dining-room,
and parlor, are of clear pine, the architraves are 8 inches wide, and
“double-moulded,” with panelled back to each window. Base 7-inch and
moulded. All other rooms have 5-inch “single trim,” with back moulding,
and base to match. All doors panelled and moulded; all room-doors have
mortise locks, and closet-doors have rim-locks, all with brass bolts
and keys; knobs and escutcheons of porcelain, and all saddles are of
hard-wood. All parts of this house that are usually painted should have
two coats of paint of the best materials, and of such colors as shall
suit the owner. All hard-wood, such as the stair-rail, bath-room finish,
and saddles, should have two coats of linseed-oil.... COST.—Contractors
everywhere differ in their estimates for work of any kind. These
differences are sometimes the result of some peculiar circumstance, but
most generally they arise through some misapprehension of fact; either
the plans are incomprehensible, or the description of them ambiguous,
leading to a variety of interpretations, and consequently a variety of
prices, some of which are too low, and some too high. The low man who
usually _proposes_ to do the best work, and the most of it, gets the
job, and executes the work in accordance with his preconceived ideas,
gets his money, and leaves the owner in possession of something he did
not expect. No one can know the extent and character of the work better
than the projector of them, who should be equally qualified to give exact
estimates of quantities and cost of everything connected with their
thorough development and execution, and thus truly fulfill his mission as
the architect of the works. Cost is one of the most interesting features
in any project, and no plan is hardly worth considering that does not
comprehend in some way the expense of its execution. Builders and others
interested in such plans, will appreciate the detailed estimates, as
furnishing the key to the whole plan, supplying the needed information as
to the real quality and character of the work.—ESTIMATE:

DESIGN XVIII.

A SOUTHERN HOUSE COSTING $2,200.


This plan of a simple, yet genteel Southern house, embraces ample
interior accommodation for the wants of a good-sized family. It has
an abundance of outside verandas and artificial shade, and may be
constructed at a very moderate cost.... EXTERIOR, (fig. 73.)—The style is
adapted to the Middle and Southern States, because of its elevation and
airiness, the overhanging projections of its roof, and the facility with
which wings or verandas may be added. The Tower is a conspicuous feature,
and though without any special ornamentation, it gives an expression of
unity and completeness to the whole structure. The Verandas on every
side afford protection from the sun. Many persons prefer disconnected
verandas (as shown in figs. 73 and 75), with open ends to the roofs for
the escape of the heated air that would otherwise be retained in them.
Moreover, disconnected verandas prevent the annoyance arising from the
noise made by children who are fond of running and playing upon them....
CELLAR, (fig. 74.)—This is under the kitchen wing only; is 6½ feet
deep, has two windows, an outside entrance with stone steps, and a
stairway leading to the rear entry of the first floor.... FIRST STORY,
(fig. 75.)—Hight of ceiling in the main house, 11 feet, and in the wing
9 feet. The entrance Hall, nearly square, and entered from the front
piazza through double doors, contains the main stairs, and communicates
with the parlor and dining-room. Each of these apartments communicates
with the library through large sliding-doors. The windows to these rooms
open to the floor, and are protected on the outside by the verandas.
The front parlor window is 6½ feet wide, with the sashes arranged to
slide in pockets at either side, by which means the parlor is apparently
prolonged to, and may be used with the veranda. Each of the large rooms
has fire-places and marble mantles. The closet for the dining-room is
under the main stairs. The Kitchen is in the rear wing, and separated
from the main house by the rear lobby and the pantry; it has a good-sized
double window at each side, a large pantry, and a fire-place. In the rear
entry are stairways leading to the second story and to the cellar....
SECOND STORY, (fig. 76.)—Hight of ceilings in main house, 9 feet, and
in the wing 7 feet. It is divided into six chambers, besides halls and
closets. The three larger Chambers have fire-places with marble shelves,
and two windows in each. The window in the small chamber is placed near
the ceiling, above the kitchen roof. The two Chambers in the wing are
intended as servants’ rooms, and have no communication with the main
house.... TOWER AND ATTIC.—The Tower has an inclosed stairway, with
a door at the foot. The main roof finish at the rear of the tower is
leveled even with the main ridge, inclosing the intervening space; this
affords room for a door leading from the tower to the attic. This story
is thoroughly floored, and has small windows in each gable, and is useful
as a place for storage. In cases of necessity, a portion of this attic
may be used for bedrooms.... CONSTRUCTION.—The Cellar excavations are
made in the ground 4½ feet deep, and for the underpinning of the main
house one foot. The loose earth is used in grading, raising the surface
immediately surrounding the foundation 8 inches. The foundation walls
are 8 inches thick, of hard brick and good mortar. The cellar walls
are 6½ feet high, and the underpinning 3 feet 2 inches high, leaving
an exposed surface 18 inches high at completion. Only the portions of
the foundation plan, shown darker in the plan, fig. 74, are walled, the
intervening spaces being left open for the free circulation of air.
The general character of the materials to be used in the construction
of this house (a large portion of which is milled, and manufactured
ready for use,) may be inferred from the appended estimate. The manner
of putting these materials together is of great importance, and should
be entrusted only to skillful and thorough workmen. The details of
the exterior finish are so plain, that the work of “getting out” the
several parts may be done by the mechanics employed in building, without
recourse to the scroll-saw or carver. The truss-work of the cornices,
and the open frame-work, and columns of the verandas, are of dressed
timber, and stop-chamfered. All the roofs have sufficient pitch to allow
the use of shingles, which are much lighter and cooler than slate or
metal. Veranda roofs so constructed do not reflect so much heat into
the chamber windows as others, which is important in a warm climate....
VENTILATION.—Large window openings, with easy working sashes, are
provided, and afford the best means of changing the air of any apartment.
The chimneys are large, and have open fire-places, and ventilating
side-flues with registers near the ceilings. These openings, which should
never be closed, will be found to afford satisfactory ventilation. During
seasons of extreme heat, the tower may be made to serve as a general
ventilator, by lowering the upper sashes, and opening all the doors
leading to it. The following estimate includes everything necessary to
complete this building in a thorough manner, at prices now ruling in the
vicinity of New York.—ESTIMATE:

DESIGN XIX.

A STONE HOUSE, COSTING $2,500.


This plan has many features to commend it as an economical country
house. It is similar in many respects to Design XXVII., having an equal
breadth of front, and is constructed of like substantial materials.
The arrangement of the several parts, however, are more regular and
compact, and embrace accommodations for a good-sized family.... EXTERIOR,
(fig. 77.)—At first sight, the reader will perceive the perfect balance
apparent in the outlines and details of the front. Variety is also an
especial feature, resulting from the pleasing diversity and systematic
distribution of the prominent parts. The site has much effect upon the
appearance of any building. This house should have a commanding position
to afford such views as would seem to be expected from its broad and
generous windows. Health and happiness being largely dependent on
the situation, it is important to select a position having a natural
drainage, and therefore more likely to be surrounded with pure wholesome
air.... CELLAR, (fig. 78.)—Hight 6½ feet. The plain engraving saves the
need of further explanation. The ceiling is smoothly “laid off” with
one coat of plaster, and the walls are flush-pointed, so that the whole
interior may be whitewashed whenever it shall be desirable to lighten
or sweeten the cellar.... FIRST STORY, (fig. 79.)—As is suggested by
the exterior, system and order are prominent features in the interior
arrangement. The main entrance is through double doors. The principal
hall is central and roomy, and contains the open and balustered stairway
to the second story. The two principal rooms are of equal size, with
outlooks front and rear. The Parlor has a pleasant bay or plant window,
arranged to be shut off, when desirable, by large sash doors. This window
has no floor, but is cemented around its sides below the floor-line, to
secure dryness to the walls, and is filled with earth wherein plants
may be grown. The thick masonry surrounding this plant-bed will secure
it from frost. The temperature required to make the parlor comfortable
will be sufficient for the plants, while the strong sunlight will
insure their vigorous growth. A mirror may be placed on the mantle
opposite this window, arranged to reflect its contents, and make a most
cheerful picture.—The Living-room is a convenient apartment, in easy
communication with the front and rear entrances, the wood-house, and
cellar-stairs, passing down under the front hall stairs. It has a large
pantry, and is provided with a range, sink, stationary wash-tubs, water,
and waste-pipes. The importance of having cold and hot water always
ready should not be overlooked. Very much of the drudgery of housework
in the country consists in drawing and carrying water, and besides, it
generally happens that when water is most wanted, the vessels are empty,
necessitating great inconvenience and frequent distress.—The Bedroom is
situated between the parlor and living-room, and communicates with both,
and has a good-sized closet. This apartment may be used as a sewing-room,
where such work need not be put away every time it is laid down for a
moment. The Wood-house at the rear is constructed of light materials,
and serves as a fuel and utensil room.... SECOND STORY, (fig. 80.)—This
story is divided into five chambers, a hall, and seven closets. Each room
is entered directly from the hall, obviating the too frequent necessity
of passing through one room to reach another. Closets are a necessity
to any well ordered household; their uses are so numerous that it is
hardly possible to provide too many.... REMARKS ON CONSTRUCTION.—The
element of durability is an important quality of this structure, avoiding
the necessity and expense of frequent repairs. The exterior walls are
constructed of stone and brick, as described in Design XXVII. Care should
be taken to make these walls perfectly solid and thorough. The mortar
used should be of the best lime, and coarse, sharp sand. Such mortar
improves with age, always increasing in hardness and strength. The brick
corner-work may be laid in dark or blue mortar with good effect in
subduing the strong contrasts in color. Interior plastering should never
be applied directly to the stone-work. Such walls do not readily conform
to the sudden changes of the surrounding temperature, and are rendered
damp and unwholesome from the moisture of the air being condensed upon
them. They should be furred off, leaving an air-space between the
stone-work and plastering, through the whole hight of the wall, and
opening into the spaces between the rafters of the roof. Side-walls
constructed in this manner afford a most comfortable interior, having a
more equal temperature than is possible in the usual frame building, and
neither the severe cold of winter, nor the extreme heat of summer, is
immediately felt within. The chimneys are of hard brick; their interior
location insures a great saving of fuel, as the heat that is radiated
from them greatly assists in warming the house. The principal roofs are
covered with dark slate. “Keystone” and “Chapman” are good qualities,
and are mostly used in this vicinity; they have good color, and do not
fade. A good effect is produced by clipping the exposed corners of about
one-third of the slate, in a uniform manner, and laying them in belts of
five or six courses each across the roof.

DESIGN XX.

A COUNTRY HOUSE, COSTING $2,600.


This plan is somewhat similar in style and materials to Design XXIV.
The changes here indicated adapt it to a more southern climate, such as
larger window openings, more piazzas, and placing the domestic rooms at
the _rear_ of the main building.... EXTERIOR, (fig. 81.)—“Double front”
houses (as those having their front entrance in the center are usually
called), may face any point of compass, and are adapted to almost any
situation. They appear best when located at sufficient distance from
the road to allow extended, neatly laid-out approaches, and thus give
an air of retirement.... CELLAR, (fig. 82.)—Hight, 7 feet. Full size
of the main building, with window openings on every side.... FIRST
STORY, (fig. 83.)—Hight of ceilings in main house, 11 feet; in the
wing, 9 feet. The apartments embraced in the main house are unusually
large, airy, and pleasant. All the windows open down to the floor, and
are protected from sun and rain by the piazza. The Hall has a wide
entrance leading from the piazza, and contains the principal flight of
stairs. The Parlor and Living-room are of equal size (14 × 24 feet),
have windows looking in three directions, and have open fire-places
in each. The rear entry occupies part of the main house and wing, its
hight of ceiling is determined by the platform of the main stairs. It
communicates conveniently with the rear piazza, main hall, living-room,
kitchen, cellar-stairs, and a closet. In the Wing are a kitchen,
work-room or summer-kitchen, butler’s pantry, and two closets. The
Kitchen communicates with the living-room through the butler’s pantry,
which is “dresser-finished” with drawers and shelving. The work-room is
furnished with a pump, sink, and two stationary wash-tubs. If desired, a
bath-room may be placed in this wing, and fitted up with the necessary
plumbing, as shown in Design XXXIII.... SECOND STORY, (fig. 84.)—Hight of
ceiling, 9 feet. A hall, three chambers, a bedroom, and four closets are
the divisions of this story. The stairs leading to the attic are placed
above those of the first story, with a door at the foot.... ATTIC.—The
estimate provides for a floor in this, and for casing the four pair of
windows, but it is otherwise left unfinished. Four or more bedrooms may
be made in this story if desired.... CONSTRUCTION.—The materials are
indicated in the estimate. The foundation-walls show 2 feet above the
ground. The timber is framed and raised in the most thorough manner.
The beams are placed 2 feet apart from centers, and bridged with one
row of “cross-bridging” in each span. Observe that the main posts are
25 feet long; this includes the whole hight from bottom of sills to top
plates, and allows for four feet of inside breastwork from the attic
floor to foot of main rafters. The main roof is set at an angle of 45°.
The “open-worked” barges in the pediment (fig. 81), are of 1¼-inch-plank,
16 inches wide, pierced in simple figure, and require only one set of
patterns for the four gables. The piazza-rafters show in their ceilings.
Perforated pediments in each side allow the escape of heated air from
under the roofs. The columns are “boxed” 7 inches square, and chamfered.
The spandrels are scroll-sawed from 3-inch timber. The two full stories
are hard finished on two coats of brown mortar and seasoned lath. All
doors are panelled, and all architraves in the main house are double
moulded; in the wing single moulded. All sashes are 1½ inch thick, and
glazed with second quality French glass. The parlor and living-room
have marble mantles; the chambers have marble shelves resting on stucco
trusses. The main stairs have an 8-inch octagon newel, a 2¼ × 4¼ moulded
hand-rail, and 2-inch fluted balusters, all of black walnut, as also
are the saddles to each room. All knobs, roses, and escutcheons are of
white porcelain. All wood usually painted has two coats of best paint, in
shades to suit the owner’s taste.

          Total cost, complete.                                  $2,600.00

The following detailed estimate of the cost of windows and doors,
“complete,” are given in explanation as to what is included in the
foregoing and other lists, viz.:

    Total.                                    $9.08

Where there are an equal number of each class, I should put their cost at

for doors. The figures (22 feet) are an average per door, deduced from
careful calculations, and are introduced here for the purpose of aiding
any one in readily making up an estimate for a whole building.

DESIGN XXI.

A FARM-HOUSE COSTING $2,600.


These plans were designed for a convenient and comfortable Farm-house
in the American style, comprehending the most economical and practical
methods of construction. The size and shape of such houses should be made
to conform to the requirements of those who are to occupy them. Unlike
the villager, the farmer has ample road front, and his house should be so
arranged as to secure the most pleasant outlook from the living rooms.
For many important reasons a farmer’s house should be set back from the
highway at least 75 feet, 200 feet is much better. Everyone appreciates a
nice lawn in front of a country home, through which inviting approaches
lead from the road entrances bordered with flowers, and where space is
allowed for shade trees and shrubbery. The width of country roads when
first projected is usually limited to 50 feet. There is no certainty,
however, that an increased width or the straightening of a roadway will
not be demanded at any time and such contingencies should be provided
for. Other considerations require but a moment’s thought to convince
anyone of the desirableness of an ample front lawn.... EXTERIOR, (fig.
85.)—Farm houses usually stand disconnected and apart from other
buildings, and should have outlines that will best adapt them to the
conditions that are otherwise manifest in the location. This plan is
intended for an eastern frontage, where it would face the morning sun,
when the principal and broader portions of the building, at the right,
would be doubly valuable as a shield to ward off the northern winds from
the parts of the house most used by the occupants. (By reversing the plan
it would be equally adapted to the opposite, or easterly side of a road.)
It is intended that the body of the house shall be set at least two feet
above the ground; this gives opportunity for good-sized cellar-windows,
that will admit light, and afford good openings for cellar ventilation,
and also secure the frame-work of the building against moisture from the
ground. Such moisture, if allowed, will cause decay of the sills and
other principal timbers, and is sure to percolate upward into the house,
filling it with unwholesome vapors. The variety of the general outlines
as shown in the elevation are calculated to impart a cheerful and lively
appearance always desirable in a country home, and very pleasant to
the passer-by. The ridged roofs, with their spreading gables and ample
projections, are features of frankness in which there is no attempt at
concealment or imitation. The bay-windows, wide entrance, and spacious
piazza, are each expressive of liberality and refinement. The extreme
simplicity of the details, and methods of construction, devoid of all
ostentatious display, clearly express the purpose of the building, and
commend it to the consideration of all who are interested in rural house
building.... FOUNDATION, (fig. 86.)—In most locations stone are abundant;
our estimate comprehends the building of the foundation-walls of rough,
broken stone, laid in coarse mortar, and neatly pointed where exposed to
sight. Any man who is at all familiar with the most ordinary stone-work,
such as building “wall” fences, could build these foundations acceptably;
they should be laid up 18 inches thick, and flush with the outside of the
frame-work of the building. Our plan shows a cellar under the central
part of the building only, which should be 7 feet deep; this cellar will
be found sufficiently spacious for the uses of most families, but may
be enlarged if desirable. One of the “wise sayings” we heard in youth
was, “always build your cellar under the whole house.” Unless there are
ample cellars under the barns, the house-cellar is never too large. In
this case, it will be but little extra cost and labor to take out the
earth, and carry the foundations down. The walls provided would do most
of this, and then we have ample cellars for all wants, and have room to
partition off fruit and vegetable rooms, the former of which need to be
much cooler than the latter, if one would keep fruit well. The side-walls
of the area are built of the same materials as the cellar-walls, with
the stone steps inserted while building. The foundations shown on the
plan where no cellar is required, are built of the same materials, laid
in trenches, which have been excavated 18 inches wide, and 2 feet deep.
The chimney foundations should be started and laid up with the other
walls. A very effectual ventilation may be provided from the cellar by
arranging an opening that shall lead to the left-hand flue of the kitchen
chimney; this flue will be warmed by contact with the range when in
use, and a strong draft will be made, which will exhaust the damp, foul
odors so common in deep cellars. It will be observed that the cellar is
protected from the extreme changes of outward temperature by the walls
and spaces at each side, and by the partial coverings in front and
rear.... FIRST STORY, (fig. 87.)—This story is divided into three large
and three small rooms, and hall. By this plan, the kitchen is intended
as the living-room of the family, and is so arranged as to be the most
_convenient and pleasant room in the house_; has large windows front
and rear, which will admit an abundance of light, and afford an outlook
each way. A large range is placed in the fire-place, with a water-back
connecting with the boiler in the laundry. The clock and lamp-shelf is
placed on the opposite side of the room from the fire-place: _should
never be over it_. Adjoining the kitchen, and connected with it, is a
pantry, containing shelving, drawers, and a wash-tray, with cold and hot
water. The Laundry, or _work-room_, is arranged to connect directly with
the kitchen and pantry, and leads to the rear outside door. This room
is fitted up so that the principal kitchen-work may be done in it, with
great facility, and with few steps, and contains a closet, sink, pump,
wash-tubs, tank, and boiler. The hight of the ceiling in this room is
10 feet in the clear. The Tank (not shown in the drawings), is situated
close up to the ceiling, above the pantry door, is 8 feet long, 3 feet
wide, and 2 feet deep. The boiler is of copper, 40-gallon capacity,
and is placed directly in the rear of the kitchen chimney. The sink and
wash-tubs are shown on the plan, and are to be provided with cold and
hot water. The force-pump is placed next to the sink, under the tank—by
this method but little plumbing is required, and a very perfect and
satisfactory arrangement is secured. The boiler keeps the temperature of
this room sufficiently warm to prevent damage to the pipes from frost.
The Bedroom also adjoins the kitchen, and has a closet for clothing, and
two windows. The principal Hall, included in the central building, is
entered through large double doors from the front piazza, and connects
through doors with the parlor, kitchen, and back passage, and contains
the principal stairs, which are of easy “platform” construction. The
Parlor has a large bay-window, marble mantle, and adjoins the library
through large sliding-doors. The Library has a marble mantle, and closet,
and connects with the back passage at the rear of the principal stairs.
The Front Piazza has its ends sheltered by the projections at each
side, and is arranged to require but two columns. If desirable at any
time, a part of this piazza can be enclosed with sash at very little
expense, which would provide a very convenient conservatory for plants
and flowers. The rear “shed” is provided with a roof and columns, but has
no wooden floor. It is intended that the grounds around the rear of the
central building shall be graded well up, say within a foot of the rear
door-sills, so as to require but a single step, or large flat stone, to
each door. The outside cellar doors would be made to lay even with the
final grade, and hung to the coping-stones of the area-walls, and the
remaining space paved or flagged with stone. When once properly done,
the finish of this character will last a lifetime without trouble, while
wood-work could never be satisfactory, and would often require renewal.
Whenever the cellar doors are opened, they are hooked up against the
columns, where they form a railing, or guard, to prevent the usual
danger of an open hatchway.... The SECOND STORY (fig. 88), has a hall,
four large and three small chambers, with four closets, and stairway
leading to the attic. Each of the large Chambers has two windows, and
a ventilating register in the flue of the chimney adjoining. All these
rooms have full hight ceilings, and are not so close to the roof as to
be affected by their absorbed heat of summer, but have complete square
ceilings, with large air-spaces between them and the roofs. The Attic of
the principal building is completely floored, and has windows in each
gable or pediment, and may be used for storage, drying clothes in stormy
weather, and for many other purposes.... CONSTRUCTION.—The estimate
appended indicates the kind and quantity of materials used, which will
be found to be such as are now most generally adopted for buildings of
this character. The work is very simple, and may be executed by the
simplest methods. Information concerning the application and uses of the
“felting” may be found in Design XI. We have before suggested that “there
are circumstances that would justify the building of one part of a house
first.” Should it be desirable, the central portion of this house could
be built first, and would be found quite sufficient as the dwelling house
of a small family, and the remainder added afterwards as required....

DESIGN XXII.

A HOUSE COSTING $2,800.


This plan of a suburban, or a country house, has all the advantages of
the square form—providing convenient, commodious interior apartments,
and has a simple, expressive outside dress, that compares favorably
with more pretentious, expensive dwellings.... EXTERIOR, (fig. 89.)—The
outlines of the main building are rounded and compact, indicating
completeness and solidity. The front tower-like projection is a central
and distinctive feature, around which the other parts are symmetrically
balanced. The Porch and roofed balconies are simple and neat. The main
roof, a new modification of the “Mansard roof,” is a conspicuous part,
giving an expression of strength and unity to the design. The main
cornice has full projections, with neat solid trusses, and is separated
into sections by the chamber windows, giving relief from the monotony
and depressing effects usual in all continuous horizontal lines. All
the second story windows of the main building have projecting hoods
appropriately interlaced with the principal roof work, securing pleasant
shadows to those parts, and imparting a marked finish and variety. The
dormer windows are triangular, and are placed immediately above those
of the lower stories, prolonging the vertical lines of openings, to
which they form a fitting termination.... FIRST STORY, (fig. 90.)—Hight
of ceiling, 10 feet. The usual front hall is dispensed with, and the
stairway is placed where it is more convenient and accessible, and is not
a conductor of cold drafts through the house. Many think it necessary to
have stairways share with the parlors the most valuable and conspicuous
position; they should more frequently be placed in some subordinate
relation, without seeming to control the general arrangement. The
entrance from the front porch is through double doors to the vestibule,
and thence to either the parlor or family-room. Side doors lead to the
pleasant and shady front balconies. The Parlor and Family-room are of
equal size, and may be used as one spacious apartment by opening the
sliding doors. The Dining-room is pleasantly situated, and opens into the
family-room, rear entrance, and hallway. It has one large bay-window,
and two plain ones, an open fire-place, and a dish or china closet, _c_.
The Kitchen is isolated, relieving other rooms of its noise and odors,
is convenient to the dining-room, cellar-stairway, and rear entrance,
through the rear lobby, and has an open fire-place, closet, and large
pantry, range, boiler, sink, wash-tubs, and the necessary pipes for
water. The hall is central, accessible from the parlor, dining-room, and
rear entrance, and is thoroughly lighted and ventilated by the window at
the head of the stairs.... SECOND STORY, (fig. 91.)—Hight of ceiling,
8 feet. This story contains a hall, four good-sized chambers, with
closets, and two windows to each. The Bath-room has bath-tub and seat. A
Conservatory connects through sash doors with the two front chambers....
ATTIC, (fig. 92.)—Hight of ceiling, 8 feet. The stairs to this are placed
immediately above those to the second story, are ceiled in, with a door
at the bottom. The rear portion is finished on a line with the two
chimneys, into two bedrooms and a hall. The front portion is floored,
but otherwise left unfinished as an open garret, valuable as a play-room
for the children, a clothes drying-room, and many other purposes....
CONSTRUCTION.—The Foundation, of hard brick and good mortar, is shown
by the _Cellar plan_, (fig. 93.)—It shows four feet above the grade
in front, and, if desirable, may show one-half that hight in the rear.
There is usually sufficient earth taken from the cellar excavations to
give such desirable grade as shall turn off all water from the immediate
grounds and walks. The chimneys are also of hard brick, are independent
of the foundations, and are carried up perfectly plumb to the roof,
where they are finished with neat bases and caps. The central position
of these chimneys is proof against cold-air openings at their sides, and
insures saving the heat radiated from them. It is impossible to prevent
cracks from appearing along the sides of chimneys in frame buildings,
and when these cracks communicate directly with the outside covering,
they often admit much cold air.—The principal frame is 20 ft. high,
substantially constructed, as indicated by the upright section (fig.
94). The main plates are in line with the beams of the attic story, and
the roof-purlins are 8 feet above them. The side-rafters are 12 feet
long, fitted and spiked to the purlins and plates, with their lower
ends extending 2½ feet down from the latter in a continuous line. Rough
brackets connecting the rafters with the upright frame-work, forming
the foundations or frame of the principal cornice. By this method of
extending the rafters downward instead of upward, the desirable hight and
proportion of roof are obtained. The exposed surfaces that require siding
are reduced from the usual hight of 22½ feet to 16 feet, and the cornices
are more substantial and less complex. The siding, roof-boarding,
slating, and trimming are done in the usual manner. The gutters are laid
in with the slate, as described in Design V. The hoods and dormer windows
have slate coverings, interlaced with the principal roof, with joinings
and flashings of sheet-lead. The following estimate provides for the
thorough completion of the building in an appropriate and substantial
manner.—ESTIMATE:

DESIGN XXIII.

A COUNTRY OR VILLAGE HOUSE, COSTING $2,800.—FOR PHYSICIANS, LAWYERS,
CLERGYMEN, JUSTICES, NOTARIES, EDITORS, ETC.


This plan is designed to meet the wants of a large class residing in the
country, or smaller villages, who are not only directly interested in
agricultural pursuits, but who have also some professional or official
vocation, such as: Physicians, Lawyers, Justices, Notaries, Clergymen,
etc. They require in connection with their residences an apartment
adapted to their special callings, that shall in no way interfere with
their domestic arrangements, where all persons making business calls
may enter without feeling that they are intruding on the privacy of the
household.... ELEVATION, (fig. 95.)—The exterior outlines and dress of
this plan are a fair representation of the prevailing styles of American
rural house architecture, in its most genteel and practical forms.
There is a manifest propriety in the strong and decided features of the
exterior finish of this example, wherein each part has its distinctive
characteristics of utility, harmony, and truthfulness—a combination
that never fails to please even the most tasteful, and it may therefore
be regarded as the real basis of beauty. We frequently meet with
oddly-proportioned country houses, evidently constructed with a sole
regard to utility, that present a stunted and cadaverous appearance,
having been shorn of their beauty through a mistaken idea that _economy_
precludes the least indulgence in taste. Good taste only demands that
every separate part of any building shall be in harmony with the whole,
and this feature of harmony is not so much a subject of expense as
of expression, being a result of _mode_ rather than the _matter_ of
construction. The materials necessarily required for any building assume
shape and expression according to the methods of their application, and
they may be applied in disproportion, so as to be of permanent disgrace;
whereas the same materials properly and intelligently used, with a like
expense of handling, develop into proportionate and expressive forms of
elegance and grace. A building constructed as indicated by these plans
presents a pleasing appearance from any direction, each face being broken
by wings or other projections, which give relief from the formalities
of a large, flat surface. From the front there is an expression of
completeness indicating full provision for comfort, and an air of
contentment. From the sides are presented to the best advantage the more
extended surfaces, including the large corniced gables of the principal
building, the rear wing, and other projections. The rear has an equally
finished and satisfactory appearance.... THE CELLAR (fig. 96), is the
full size of the ground-plans, with a clear hight of 7 feet. The five
cellar windows are placed where they will admit light to every part. An
outside entrance is under the rear lobby, and a stairway leads directly
to the kitchen.... FIRST STORY, (fig. 97.)—The arrangement is very simple
and convenient, comprising good-sized hall, parlor, living-room, kitchen,
office, study, five closets, and two stairways, with ceilings 10 feet
high. The Parlor is pleasantly situated, has two front windows opening
directly to the piazza, from which they derive shade and protection.
The Dining or living-room opens into the hall, parlor, and kitchen,
and has two closets. One end of this room is octagonal, and extends 6
feet beyond the face of the principal, with three windows, affording a
pleasant outlook. The Kitchen adjoins the dining-room, has two closets,
is fitted up with a range, sink, and wash-tubs, and is conveniently
connected with the cellar and with second story by private stairways. The
Office is entered from the front porch, and is in direct communication
with the principal hall, has a good-sized closet from the space under the
principal stairs, and has a private room or Study.... SECOND STORY, (fig.
98.)—This is divided into four commodious apartments, beside a hall,
bath-room, and the necessary closets, and has ceilings 8 feet high in the
main building, and 7 feet in the rear wing. The Bath-room is provided
with a seat-closet and bath-tub. An inclosed stairway leads to the Attic,
where two or more bedrooms may be finished, besides leaving space for
garret purposes. The tank placed over the ceiling of the bath-room is
arranged to receive water from the principal roof, and is provided with
an overflow pipe leading to the cistern.... GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.—Full
brick foundations are estimated for. Where coarse stone can be had, they
answer as well, and at less cost, for the portions below ground; they
should be laid even with the brick-work on the inside when finished.
The wood-work is to be substantially constructed of good and sufficient
materials throughout. The roofs of the piazza, stoop, bay, lobby, and
window caps, are covered with charcoal tin, and in each case an allowance
is made for a “flashing” of 6 inches in width to turn up behind the
siding, to prevent leakage. The principal and the two wing roofs are each
covered with dark slate with ridge plates of zinc. The gutters are to
be those described for Design V. The joinings of the wing-roofs against
the main building are made perfectly tight by laying in, against the
building, right angle strips of zinc or tin “flashing,” with each course
of slate before the siding is put on. Slate is unquestionably the best
material for such roofing when the form of roof will admit of its use;
its cost is the same as for good tinning, and about 2 cents per square
foot in excess of pine shingles; when once properly done, will last for
centuries; it is fire-proof, and the water from it is much purer, an
important consideration when rain and cistern water is used for cooking
or drinking. Its color and appearance are agreeable—in fact roofs of
other materials are often painted in imitation of slate from choice....
The most expressive portions of any buildings are their projecting
cornices. As a rule, for houses of this style, such projections should
be _one inch for every foot of their hight from the foundation_. And the
same rule will apply to every detail of the exterior finish; for example,
as in this case, the principal building being 22 feet high at the plate,
the principal cornices should project 22 inches; the piazza being 11 feet
high, its cornice projects 11 inches; the windows, 6 feet high, have caps
projecting 6 inches, etc. By this simple rule, all such projections may
be readily determined, and thus secure perfect proportion and harmony
of parts.... The inside plastering is “three-coat work.” All side-walls
should be continued down _close_ to the floor, to prevent the passage of
air or sound. Care should be taken to make the walls straight and true,
with the second coat of “browning,” for the last or white coat, though
applied in the best manner, can never overcome malformations in the body
of the plastering; on the contrary, the finer the finish of last coat,
the more visibly will such defects appear. In the concluding estimate, 28
cents per yard is allowed for the cost of plastering, which is ample, as
shown by these calculations _for 100 yards_, viz.:

  2,000 lath, at $2 per M.                                           $4.00

          Estimated at 28c. per yard.                               $28.00

In some localities, a practice prevails among masons of including in
their measurements of plastering one-half of the openings of doors and
windows, which is obviously unjust, and a frequent cause of dispute.
Such openings will average at least 2 yards each—in this house would
aggregate 50 yards—and in every case should be deducted, unless otherwise
agreed previously.—ESTIMATE:

DESIGN XXIV.

A FARM-HOUSE COSTING $2,800.


This plan will be recognized as comprehending the general characteristics
of those given in Designs XXI. and XXVI. It is designed to be constructed
of similar materials, with a like variety of pleasing and decided
outlines, and to give an equal amount of accommodation and convenience.
The division and arrangement of the several parts, however, are
entirely changed, being especially intended to meet the requirements
of a location having a _western_ frontage. Location is an important
consideration, involving many questions of adaptation, that should always
guide to the selection of such a plan as will express a natural fitness
for the situation, and truthfully indicate its purpose.... EXTERIOR,
(fig. 99.)—Only two feet of the foundation-walls are exposed to sight,
which brings the frame-work of the building quite near enough to the
ground. The surface of the earth surrounding such buildings should have
a grade of _at least_ one-half inch to the foot, for the distance of
50 feet in every direction, to insure the turning away of all surface
water from the walks and grounds. Another good result derived from such
grade is the additional altitude given to the building, imparting a
much better appearance. The general outlines of the elevation are very
simple, devoid of all pretentious ornamentation. The wide frontage,
the large and numerous openings, and ample roofs, are each expressive
of frankness and hospitality, eminently befitting the home of the
farmer. The front Porch is unusually wide, and arranged to have large
columns, and stationary seats at either side. The Bay-window has square
projections, instead of octagonal, which are equally appropriate in this
case, and less costly. The cornices of the principal building project
20 inches, and those of the wing 16 inches, and both are provided with
scroll-sawed trusses. The chimney-tops are large, and heavily capped. The
same general finish, as is shown on the front, is put on the sides and
rear, so that the building presents an equally complete and satisfactory
appearance from every direction. Buildings of this character should be
set back from the street line at least 50 feet—150 feet would be much
better—to give room for trees, shrubbery, and walks.... CELLAR, (fig.
100.)—The plans provide for a cellar under the principal building only,
which gives a clear space of 22 × 25 feet. If desired, the space beneath
the wing may be included at an additional cost of $65. The excavations
for the cellar in the earth is 3 feet 8 inches deep; this allows the
foundation-walls to be 7 feet high. The earth thrown out is to be graded
around the building to the hight of 1½ foot, thus leaving two feet of
the foundation exposed on the outside. Country houses are frequently
set so low down as to be a matter of regret ever afterwards. There are
constant accumulations of dust, and other matter, caught and held by the
shrubbery and grasses, so that there is soon discovered a seeming growth
of the earth upward around the house and immediate grounds, making it
impossible to adapt the grades that are desirable. It is far better that
foundations are a little too high than too low, for when too high, the
approaches can easily be raised at any time with a few loads of earth;
but when too low, there seems to be no cure, except to raise the entire
building. The foundation-walls are designed to be constructed of broken
stone, laid in coarse mortar, as more particularly described for Design
XXI.... FIRST STORY, (fig. 101.)—Hight of ceilings, 10 ft. Entire floor
measurement, 1,206 square feet, affording ample space for good-sized
apartments. The several divisions have especial regard to comfort and
convenience. The front hall, or reception room, is nearly square, of
good dimensions, is entered from the front porch through double or
folding doors, and adjoins the parlor and living-room, and contains the
principal stairs. The Parlor is unusually large, is provided with windows
in its sides, and has stucco cornices and centers in its ceilings, with
an arched finish in the bay-window. The Living, or Dining-room, is
commodious, pleasantly situated, with outlooks front and rear, and is
easily accessible all around. The Family-room is large, connects with
the dining-room and parlor, and is intended as a sitting or sewing-room.
If occasion require, this room might be used as the bed-room of an
invalid. The Work-room, or Kitchen, is conveniently arranged to have a
range, boiler, pump, sink, wash-tubs, and pipes for cold and hot water,
and adjoins the dining-room, a large pantry, and a rear entrance door,
and has a private stairway leading to the second story, with a closet
underneath. The Pantry is of ample dimensions, is conveniently arranged
with shelving, and has a zinc wash-tray, with cold and hot water-pipes,
and adjoins the kitchen, dining-room, and a china closet. The latter is
useful for storing wares not required daily. The rear shed is paved, and
the cellar doors are constructed as described for Design XXI.... SECOND
STORY, (fig. 102.)—Hight of ceiling, 9 feet in main building, and 8
feet in wing. Floor measurement, 1,276 feet, divided into 8 good-sized
rooms, besides halls, closets, and stairways. The principal hall connects
with each chamber in main building, and one room and passage in wing.
The door between the principal hall and wing-passage may be closed at
any time, cutting off communication at pleasure. The side, or “breast”
walls, in the wing, are vertical 3 feet, and are continued upward at an
angle of 45° to the ceiling, thus securing sufficient head-room. The
bath-room is exactly above the kitchen, and contains a tank, bath-tub,
and seat-closet, with pipes for cold and hot water.... ATTIC.—The stairs
to this are over the first flight, and are designed to be neatly ceiled
in with 4½-inch beaded ceiling-boards, with a door at the foot. Double
windows in each gable admit sufficient light, and afford ventilation....
REMARKS ON CONSTRUCTION.—An insight into the character of this plan, is
best had by carefully considering the materials and cost in the estimate
added. We would urge the importance of good methods and workmanship in
construction, without which all materials, however good or sufficient,
can never produce good results. The old maxim, “whatever is worth doing
at all, is worth doing well,” especially applies to building a home in
which one is to spend a lifetime. This does not imply extravagance in
any sense, only demanding such _careful and intelligent application of
the ordinary rules of construction_, as shall insure substantial work,
that will not be a continuous source of anxiety and expense. Any one
of ordinary intelligence should be able to generally superintend the
operations of the mechanics employed in constructing a farm-house. The
following _points_ are of the greatest importance. Carefully watch that
the foundation-walls are substantially laid, and accurately leveled
on their upper surfaces, so that the doors shall not strike the floor
or carpets in opening, nor the tables, chairs, or other furniture be
obliged to stand on three legs. The frame-work, when raised, should
be plumb, so that all work on or in the building can be cut square,
and applied without tedious fitting. The siding should be thoroughly
“seasoned” in the open air before using, and carefully applied with close
joints, and well nailed. The edges of all water-tables, corner-boards,
and window-frames should be painted _before_ setting. The shingles
should be carefully laid, breaking their joints at one-third of their
width, and double nailed. The flooring should be dry, close laid, and
nailed with two nails to each beam. The partitions should be set with
studding of selected widths; and their angles or corners should be
anchored firmly together, to prevent the walls from cracking in those
parts when finished. The chimneys should be carefully constructed; all
joints between the brick-work should be surely filled with mortar, to
prevent sparks from passing through to the frame-work. All mortar for
plastering should be properly mixed, and allowed sufficient time (at
least one week), for the thorough slaking of the lime, and a complete
permeation of its caustic properties. Thin coats of plastering are better
than heavy ones. A mortar that does not crack in setting or drying is
sure to be good. The interior wood finish should not be commenced until
the plastering is completely dried out, and all loose mortar is removed
from the building. All wood-work usually painted should be primed as
soon as in position. For more explicit remarks and sundry suggestions on
painting, see Design XIII.

DESIGN XXV.

A “HALF STONE” HOUSE FOR $2,800.


This plan is designed for a substantial, convenient, and inexpensive
country house. It has two full finished stories, with well-lighted
apartments of good size, and a large cellar and attic. It has also the
merit of architectural beauty, well adapted to a commanding location....
EXTERIOR, (fig. 103.)—The “half-stone” composition of the side walls, and
the strong outlines and slating of the main roof, give to this structure
a rustic, yet substantial appearance, affording both diversity and
picturesqueness, as shown in the variety of the openings and irregularity
of the several parts. The front and rear elevations are similar; by
changing the entrance doors and stairs, either side may front the road.
The details of exterior finish are so simple, and easy of execution,
that any “modification for the rear” is undesirable. Inharmonious and
unsightly curtailments in the rear finish have a depressing influence
on those obliged to face them daily, which can never be overcome by
knowing there is a good front.... CELLAR, (fig. 104.)—Hight, 6½ feet,
of which 4½ feet is below the ground surface, and therefore (with
its thick walls), frost proof. It is always important to provide for
carrying off the poisonous vapors apt to be generated in cellars. For
this purpose side openings are made near the ceiling into one of the
flues of each chimney. These flues, extending to the top, and warmed by
contact with the fires of the upper stories, have sufficient draft to
constantly change the cellar air, and prevent its ascent through the
living-rooms.... FIRST STORY, (fig. 105.)—Hight of ceilings, 10 feet.
Here are conveniently placed three large rooms, a hall, china closet,
and large pantry. Each large room has commodious windows with views in
two directions. The pleasant piazzas at both the front and rear of the
parlor, extend over and protect the entrance doors.... SECOND STORY,
(fig. 106.)—Hight of ceilings, 8 feet. The divisions are very simple,
a hall, four chambers, four closets, and a bath-room. Light railings
may be put on the roofs of the wings and piazzas to form pleasant
balconies to the windows of this story. One such balcony is shown over
the wing-roof (fig. 103); the others may be similar. The small cost of
these devices is fully repaid in their usefulness for airing purposes,
besides imparting a cheerful appearance.... GARRET OR ATTIC.—This story
is thoroughly floored, but otherwise unfinished. Should additional
chambers be required, partitions may be set over those or the second
story, duplicating that plan, with rooms having the same hight of
ceilings. The stairs are placed immediately above those of the lower
stories, are ceiled in, and have a door at the foot.... CONSTRUCTION.—The
durability, general abundance, and substantial appearance of stone, make
it the most desirable and appropriate material known for the exterior
walls of any building. The cost of cutting and dressing such material
ready for use is the principle barrier to its general adoption. By using
bricks for corners and for the finish around the openings, the most
expensive item of stone-work is saved. They need only to be “random
dressed,” and laid nearly in the shape in which they are quarried, as
more particularly described for Design XXVII. When such walls are carried
beyond the hight that is convenient for the handling of the materials,
the expense of their construction is largely increased. It is for this
reason that the “half-stone” method is particularly valuable. In this
plan, the stone-work extends only to the hight of the ceiling of the
first story; to this hight the materials may be readily wheeled on
trestled scaffolding, while to double this hight would require the use of
the tedious derrick, and additional help. The upper stories are framed of
the usual sized timber, and raised on the stone walls, which in this case
become their foundation. The main roof is constructed as shown in Design
XXII. The hight requiring siding is 4½ feet, or including water-table and
cornice, 6½ feet from the stone-work of the first story to the slating of
the roof. The main roof covering is of dark slate laid on tarred felt.
At or near the floor-line dividing the upper stories, it is appropriate
to indicate the division by the use of tinted slate, which may be laid
in close courses or in simple figures, as shown on the elevation. The
roofs of the hooded and dormer windows are also slated. The deck of the
main roof, and the roofs of the piazza, are covered with IC. charcoal
tin. The wood-finish is made of simple design, devoid of all efforts at
pretentious display, each part being chosen with especial regard for its
utility and appropriateness. The trusses, piazza-columns, and soffits are
worked of timber neatly stop-chamfered, imparting a rustic appearance to
them, in keeping with the stone-work. The water-tank is placed in the
attic, directly above and in line with the bath-tub and kitchen-range,
favoring the most practical plumbing. The soil-pipe leading from the
bath-room floor passes down through the closet adjoining the kitchen
chimney to the sewer-pipe, which is laid below the cellar bottom. The bad
smells and gases arising from confined sewage may be easily disposed of
by the insertion of a 2-inch pipe into the closet-trap (at its highest
point), and connecting it with a flue of the adjoining chimney. All
inside plastering is of three-coat work. The casing of the bath-room
and around all plumbing is in hard-wood; all other trimming of clear
pine. The Newel rail and baluster on the first-story flight of stairs
are of black-walnut. All work usually painted has two coats of best
lead and linseed-oil, with stainers to give the body (outside), a light
gray, and trimmings in imitation of “Nova Scotia stone.” Inside, parlor
and hall, in grays, dining-room in grays and drabs, kitchen in drabs,
chambers white.... COST.—Prices of building materials are quite as low
as they were before the war; many kinds are really selling for the cost
of their production or manufacture. Labor is also very cheap, nearly at
old figures. Those contemplating building, and having the means at hand
to do so, need not wait for a more favorable time. As soon as general
business improves, there must be a “rise” in materials, especially such
as require to be manufactured. The estimate appended includes the cost of
all materials and labor for good work at the prices now ruling near New
York city.—ESTIMATE OF THE COST:

DESIGN XXVI.

A FARM-HOUSE COSTING $2,900.


This plan of a farm-house embraces a commodious and convenient interior,
with such external features as to clearly express its purpose. It will
be recognized as at once adapted to rural situations and domestic life,
providing much valuable space, and affording a variety of pleasing and
symmetrical outlines, with due economy in expense of construction.
Perhaps the most striking feature is the _breadth_ of the front, which is
51 feet. (The average depth is 22 feet 7 inches.) As far as practicable,
all prolonged vertical lines are avoided, leaving horizontal ones to
prevail, as of more practical utility and value. Where opportunities
abound for “spreading out,” as in the country, it would be obviously
incompatible to build tall, or stilted houses, that would not comport
with their surroundings, nor provide the conveniences desirable in all
rural habitations.... ELEVATION, (fig. 107.)—The general details of the
elevation are made up of simple parts so appropriated and balanced,
that they harmonize with each other, and secure a graceful outline.
The principal, or main portions of this building will be observed to
be the central one, while the wings at either side are collaterals,
that give equipoise and rest to the whole structure. The steep roofs,
with their subdued pediments, and spreading cornices and dormers, the
bay and other windows, the wide entrance, and open piazza, are all
arranged so as to correspond with each other, producing an effective and
picturesque appearance. There are no efforts at scientific or elaborate
display of outside ornamentation, but has sufficient architectural
completeness to denote social cultivation and refinement. The farm-house
in XXI. was designed more especially for an _eastern_ frontage. These
plans are particularly adapted for a _southern_ frontage.... The
CELLAR, (fig. 108), extends under the whole house, and is 6½ feet deep.
An outside entrance and area are to be built and inclosed under the
stoop at the rear. Eleven small windows are provided for both light
and ventilation.... The FIRST STORY, (fig. 109), has ample apartments
adapted to the uses of a large family, embracing a good-sized hall,
parlor, living-room, kitchen, pantries, closets, and corridor. The
principal entrance is from the piazza, through large double doors to
the hall. Similar double doors on each side of the hall lead to the
parlor and dining-room. These inside double doors enable one to throw
the whole together for large family and other gatherings, and are
manifestly appropriate in dwellings of this character. The principal
stairs are semi-circular, so arranged as to occupy but little room in
the principal hall. The Parlor is situated by itself, remote from the
machinery of daily housework. The Living-room is the most central, and
most convenient and comfortable room in the house. It is so surrounded
by other apartments that summer’s heat, nor winter’s cold, can have
direct access to its sides. The large Bay-window affords an ample supply
of light, and adds to the area of the room. It adjoins and opens into
the principal hall, corridor, kitchen, and large pantry. The Kitchen
is conveniently situated, and adjoins the dining-room, corridor,
pantry, store-room, cellar, and private stairway. It is provided with
a range, sink, wash-tubs, and pipes for cold and hot water. By this
arrangement, the principal work of the family can be done with such
thoroughness and facility as to make such employment interesting and
pleasant, devoid of any sense of drudgery. The corridor is adapted to
all the uses of a rear hall, and communicates with each of the other
principal rooms of the first story. It is also an auxiliary apartment,
and may be used in connection with either of the other apartments,
and affords valuable room for many in-door occupations for both old
and young.... SECOND STORY, (fig. 110.)—The engraving is sufficiently
plain to require but little explanation. It will be seen that there are
seven rooms, besides halls and closets. The Bath-room is situated in
this story over the kitchen, and contains the bath-tub, seat-closet,
and water-tank, and is accessible from the principal building through
the passage leading from the principal hall. An opening through the
ceiling of the kitchen, with a register, would probably let warm air
enough up into the bath-room to keep frost out in winter, especially
if some fire remained in the range or stove most of the night. In all
arrangements of water-tanks and pipes, care must be taken to keep them
from being frozen in the coldest nights.... The ATTIC is completely
floored over, but is otherwise unfinished. Several bed-rooms might be
finished in this story if desirable. An open attic is always valuable for
storage, drying clothes in stormy weather, etc., and as a play-room for
children in rainy weather.... CONSTRUCTION.—Any one at all familiar with
building would see at a glance that the form and arrangements of this
plan admit of its execution in section. There are conditions that would
justify the building of the central part of this house, to be used as
the residence of a small family, and add the wings at any future time,
as circumstances might indicate.... The excavations for the cellar are
made 3½ feet deep. The foundations are 18 inches thick, and 6½ feet high,
of broken stone, laid in mortar, with the joints neatly pointed on all
surfaces exposed to sight. The earth thrown out of the cellar should
be left on the ground, and graded around the foundation, leaving but
two feet to show above the final grade. The chimneys should be started
with the principal foundation, and the materials interlaced to insure
solidity. Three fire-places are constructed in the first story; those in
the kitchen and dining-room are in one stack built “square up” to the
ceiling of the first story. Two separate flues are then continued through
the second story, on either side of the passage-way, and are afterwards
joined over an arch, and pass through the roof in one solid shaft. The
estimate indicates the general character of the work. In these rural
dwellings, the siding may be worked without the central groove shown in
Design XI. This, though less pleasing to many, would give an expression
of less artifice, and more strength.... ESTIMATE.—The following estimate
will be found correct as to quantity, and ample as to cost. Most farmers
have materials and facilities that would enable them to greatly reduce
the cost of building by this plan. The items of excavation, foundation,
carting, and painting, amount to nearly $500. Some, or each of these
parts, might be satisfactorily done by those engaged on the place:

    210 yards excavation, at 20c. per yard.                         $42.00
  1,750 ft. stone foundation, at 15c. per ft.                       262.50

DESIGN XXVII.

A STONE-HOUSE COSTING $2,900.


These plans were designed for the substantial dwelling of a farmer
in easy circumstances. The outside appearance truthfully expresses
its rural and its domestic purpose. The interior accommodations are
carefully arranged for comfort and convenience. The materials and
method of construction insure permanency; with little care, this
building would last for many generations.... EXTERIOR, (fig. 111.)—The
elevation shows that this house was intended for the country—it looks
like a farm-house—in fact it would be out of place anywhere else. Its
peculiar solid, independent, and home-like character is due to the
massive stone walls, large door and window openings, broad and steep
slated roof, truncated gables, substantial chimneys, and heavy sheltering
eaves, all arranged in simple, expressive, and harmonious combination.
All superfluous ornamentation is avoided, as inconsistent with rural
simplicity and truthfulness. Vines and creepers will be suggested by the
rough stone walls and piazza posts; and to their delicate tracery may
be left the work of “filling in” their more appropriate and agreeable
decorations.... The CELLAR (fig. 112), is 6½ feet high, extending under
the whole building, giving ample space for the storing of articles
requiring a cool, moist air for their preservation. Seven windows are
arranged to provide light and ventilation to every part. The outside
entrance is from the rear under the back stoop; stairs lead directly
up to the kitchen. The “safe” is a “locker,” or private cellar for
keeping choicer stores.... FIRST STORY, (fig. 113.)—Hight of ceilings,
10 feet. The arrangements are somewhat peculiar, and are very convenient
and pleasant. Each of the four principal rooms have windows giving
views in two different directions. The two halls (front and rear) have
stairs in each, and are otherwise arranged for easy communication with
all parts of the house. The Parlor is pleasantly situated, adjoins the
front hall and dining-room, has a large open fire-place, and is shaded
on the front by the piazza. The Dining or living-room is the largest
apartment, and communicates directly with every other room and hall on
this floor, bringing this entire story under the immediate supervision
of the mistress of the household. It has an open fire-place and two
closets. The Bedroom is placed in a quiet corner, where the little ones
may take their “day naps” without being run over or disturbed by sudden
callers, or those engaged in housework. The Kitchen is a good-sized
apartment, adjoins the dining-room, rear hall, milk-room, large pantry,
two closets, and cellar stairway, and is provided with a large range,
sink, wash-tubs, and the necessary pipes for supplies of cold and hot
water.... SECOND STORY, (fig. 114.)—Hight of ceiling, 8 feet. This
contains five good-sized chambers, a large hall, and nine closets. The
three larger chambers have full-sized side-walls and ceilings; the space
beyond the side-walls or partitions are devoted to closets, of which
there cannot be too many in any house.... CONSTRUCTION.—Unless situated
on very high ground, having a thorough natural drainage, the earth taken
from the cellar excavations should be left on the grounds and graded
around the foundation, to insure the turning away of all surface water.
In such cases, care must be taken to allow in the depth of the excavation
for the hight it is intended to raise the earth grades. The appended
estimate of cost is for excavating 3 feet deep. This will furnish 202
cubic yards of earth to raise the grades 1½ foot immediately around the
house (leaving 2 feet of the foundation exposed to sight), and give a
gentle slope outwards in every direction to the distance of 40 feet. All
the outside walls are solid masonry. The foundations are of the roughest
stone, laid in good mortar, 2 feet thick. A “top floating” of hydraulic
cement mortar is used in levelling the upper surfaces, to prevent the
ground moisture from rising above that line to be absorbed by the main
walls. The main walls are of rough stone and hard burned bricks laid
in strong mortar, 16 inches thick. The outside corners, and the jambs
and heads of the doors and windows, are of brick, as shown in fig. 115.
Their use greatly facilitates the work of construction, and obviates the
necessity of stone-dressing. The intervening walls are of broken stone
“random dressed,” laid in courses to conform to the quoin lines of the
brick-work, and may be done by common masons. The window and door sills
are of ordinary hammered blue-stone. All outside interstices and joints
are filled and pointed with cement mortar. Thin strips of wood (mason’s
lath will do) are laid in between the courses on the inside, to which
the inside furring is fastened. The chimneys are built of hard brick,
and are finished above the roof with large tops, having cross openings
at the sides for each flue, and close covers.—The Frame-work is very
simple; the central girders are supported by large posts on solid stone
footing. The beams are notched over the girders, with their ends resting
and anchored in the walls, and are thoroughly bridged. The plates are
anchored by bolts that are inlaid while building the walls. The rafters
are notched over the plates with their lower ends extending 2½ feet
beyond the walls; their centers are supported by purlins and collars. The
roof is covered with dark slate. The flooring is of mill-worked 1½-inch
plank. The interior of the stone walls is furred off, with unobstructed
spaces between the furring to the roof, for the passing off of all
dampness. The interior finish is complete throughout. The principal
rooms have neatly-moulded architraves, other rooms plain. The kitchen
and rear hall are wainscoted. All doors are panelled and moulded, and
all windows have inside blinds.—The plastering is three-coat work, with
the principal rooms hard-finished, balance white-slipped. The painting,
outside, is two coats with the best materials; inside is oil-stained and
flat-varnished.—ESTIMATE:

DESIGN XXVIII.

A HOUSE COSTING $3,000.


These plans were designed for a suburban cottage, having a cheerful
outside appearance, and containing ample interior apartments conveniently
arranged, with such modern improvements as are desirable for the use of
an ordinary sized family.... EXTERIOR, (fig. 116.)—The general outlines
are made up of simple parts, embracing features of pleasing variety and
elegance. The foundation walls, showing four feet above ground, insure
against moisture from the earth, and add to the superficial dimensions
of the structure. Such high foundations for houses of this character
afford a proper background for the grasses and shrubbery usually
surrounding them. The irregularities of the principal building, the
steep, dark-slated roofs, with their heavy projecting cornices, truncated
or hooded gables, and enriched barge-boards, together with the stoops and
bay-windows, are proportioned and arranged to assimilate with each other,
and contribute to gracefulness and harmony.... CELLAR, (fig. 117.)—Hight,
7 feet. Seven good-sized windows admit an abundance of light, and afford
thorough ventilation.... FIRST STORY, (fig. 118.)—Hight of ceiling,
10½ feet. The rooms are unusually large, and arranged to be pleasant,
comfortable, and convenient. The front entrance has large double doors.
This hall contains the principal stairs, which are of “platform”
construction. We prefer this form whenever the general plan allows it,
as such stairs are much easier, less dangerous, and appear better than
the usual long, straight flights. The hall connects with each principal
room, obviating the too frequent necessity of passing through one room
to reach another. The Parlor has a fire-place, adapted to either a grate
or fire-place heater (we should prefer the latter in this case, supplied
with heating-pipes for warming the chamber above,) and is provided with a
marble mantle. A large bay-window admits sufficient light, and affords a
pleasant outlook. The remaining sides of this room are unbroken, leaving
ample space for furniture, pictures, etc. The Dining, or living-room,
is intended as the most agreeable and pleasant room in the house; it
has a fire-place with hearth openings, adapted to a “low-down” grate,
which is a good substitute for the old home-like fire-place, and affords
an opportunity for a generous and cheerful fire, and insures the most
perfect ventilation. The ashes from these hearth fires fall into the
ash-pit below them, thus obviating the necessity and dust of their daily
removal. A marble mantle with a large hearth, one bay and three plain
windows, and a closet, are provided for this room. The windows afford
plentiful light, and views from front, side, and rear, thus assuring a
home-like, cheerful apartment. The Kitchen is pleasantly situated, has
four windows for light and ventilation, and is planned with especial
regard for convenience. It is in proximity with the principal hall, rear
entry, and cellar stairway, has a large pantry, and two closets, and
contains a large fire-place, with a range, boiler, sink, and wash-tubs
having pipe attachments for hot and cold water. The dimensions of the
fire-place are 2 feet 10 inches wide, 5 feet 6½ inches high, and 1 foot 9
inches deep, with a hearth-stone 2 feet wide, and 4 feet long. The range
is fitted into the fire-place, and has a water-back, elevated oven, and
warm-closet, and is connected by pipes with the boiler. The dumb-waiter,
shown on the plan at the right of the fire-place, is intended as a
“coal-lift,” which will save many steps and much hard labor running for
coal. This is simply a box, holding three bushels (twelve scuttles),
constructed of 1¼-inch floor planks, with wood runners 3 feet long, on
two opposite sides, conforming to grooves made in stationary planking in
the cellar, and is suspended by weights, with strong ropes, passing over
pulleys fastened to the underside of the floor-beams. The upper portions
of this closet may be fitted with shelving and hooks, as desired. The
large Kitchen Pantry, thoroughly shelved, is in the “addition” that
adjoins the kitchen, and is built in combination with the rear stoop.
The entry, conveniently situated, communicates between the kitchen and
dining-room, and with the back stoop through the rear door.... SECOND
STORY, (fig. 119.)—Hight of ceiling, 9 feet. This story is divided in
the simplest manner, has a hall, three large chambers, with closets
for each, and a bath-room, all with sufficient windows for light and
ventilation. Each principal chamber has an open fire-place, adapted to
grates. Chimneys, centrally situated, radiate most of their heat into
the rooms, thus saving fuel. The Bath-room has a French bath-tub, with
cold and hot water, and a seat-closet. The stairway to the attic story
is ceiled in over the principal stairs, with a door at the foot. The
Attic has three apartments, two intended to be plastered and finished as
chambers; the third, or larger one, is unfinished for an open garret....
GENERAL CONSTRUCTION.—The excavations are 2½ feet deep, and the loose
earth is graded around the building at completion, leaving 4 feet of the
foundation exposed to sight. The foundation-walls are built as described
for Design XXXII. The sub-sills of the windows, and the steps and coping
of the area, are of blue-stone. The chimneys being near the center, are
not connected with the foundation walls. The rear one is constructed in
box form, below the first floor, as a receptacle for ashes, and has a
small iron door near the bottom for removing the ashes. The principal
frame-work is of sound pine or spruce timber, of the sizes mentioned in
the estimate below. When practicable, we would use pine timber for all
sills and posts, as the least liable to decay, and spruce for the girts
and beams, on account of its quality for stiffness. The siding is of two
thicknesses of boarding, as described for Design XXXII. The principal
roof is constructed at the angles of 45°, securing valuable space for
attic rooms, and is covered with dark slate laid on hemlock, with tarred
paper between. The roofs of the stoops and bay-windows, and all gutters
and valleys, are of IC. charcoal tin, laid on hemlock boards. The method
of constructing the cornice, gutters, and barge boards of the principal
roof, is shown in detail in fig. 120. _A_, rafter of 3 × 4; _B_, plate of
4 × 6, placed 14 inches above the attic floor; _C_, post of 4 × 7 timber;
_D_, gutter, having no abrupt angles to bother the tinsmith, or impair
his work, but is of circular form, and stayed with 2-inch furring lath,
on which the tin is smoothly and easily laid. _E_, bracket constructed of
2 × 4, with simple scroll, sawed from 4 × 6 timber. _F_, crown moulding
of 1¼ × 3¼, worked solid; _G_, barge-board with the crown-moulding
attached; this closes the ends of the gutters to the hight of the dotted
line at _D_. The stairs, interior trimmings, and the general painting,
are intended to be similar to those described for Design XVII. In the
estimate appended will be found a full schedule of the materials required
to construct, and fully develope a house by these plans. The quantities
given may be relied on as correct, and their cost is compiled from the
prices now ruling in this vicinity.—ESTIMATE:

DESIGN XXIX.

A HOUSE COSTING $3,100.


These plans were designed for a summer residence near Toms River, N. J.
They are especially adapted to situations where the more pleasant views
are to the rear, making it desirable to have the principal rooms on that
side of the house.... EXTERIOR, (fig. 121.)—The Swiss-like style is
due to its bold roofs, wide projections, and rustic details of finish,
there being no attempt at architectural display.... FIRST STORY, (fig.
122.)—The Hall, which is unusually large, is entered from the front porch
through double doors, contains the main stairs, and communicates with
the library, parlor, dining-room, and a passage leading to the kitchen.
A Closet is finished under the stairs opening from the passage. The
Library is nearly square, with openings in the center of each of its
four sides, and is divided from the parlor by large folding-doors. The
Parlor is of good dimensions, has large windows opening to the floor,
and leading to the piazza. The Piazza is 12 feet wide, affording shade
and ample protection from storms, and may be used in pleasant weather
to enlarge the capacity of the parlor. The Dining-room is entered from
the main hall, and communicates through the pantry with the kitchen. The
Kitchen has windows front and rear, giving a good circulation of air,
and is furnished with a range, boiler, sink, and pump, connected with
the necessary piping, with supply from the cistern. Private stairways
lead to the second story, and to the cellar; the necessary pantries are
provided. The one-story Addition is divided into three parts, making
a work-room or shed, inclosing the well, a servant’s bed-room, and a
store-pantry.... SECOND STORY, (fig. 123.)—This story contains a hall,
five good-sized chambers, seven closets, and a bath-room. The hall has
nine doors leading to the several apartments, two stair landings, and a
window, while it occupies but little space. The Bath-room has a bath-tub,
seat-closet, and pipes for cold and hot water.... ATTIC, (fig. 124.)—A
hall and two chambers are finished in this story. The stairs leading to
it are inclosed, and have a door at the foot. The hall is lighted by a
dormer window in one end. At the opposite end a door leads to the space
under the wing-roof, where the tank is placed, immediately above the
bath-room.... CONSTRUCTION.—The hight of the cellar is 6½ feet, of the
first story 10½ feet, of the second story 8 feet, of the attic 7 feet.
The foundations are of brick-work, and show two feet above the final
grades. The chimneys are of brick-work, and have six open fire-places,
with hearths to each, adapted to the use of either wood or coal fuel.
The plastering is “hard-finish” on two coats of brown mortar. Stucco
cornices and centers, of simple design, are put in the first story of
the main house. Marble shelves with stucco truss-supports are put above
each fire-place. A well and cistern are included in the estimate. The
depth of the former is put at 30 feet, as the average. To avoid the
danger of the caving in of the sides while digging, it is best to make
the excavation 4½ ft. _square_ (not circular, as is usually really done.)
Rough planks, 4½ feet long, with their ends notched half way across,
are slid in to lock with each other closely against the banks, as the
excavation proceeds, making this part of the work perfectly safe in any
kind of earth. The depth of the well should be sufficient to secure at
least four feet of spring water. Of course it would be impracticable
to lay the brick-work under water that depth, and therefore a circular
curb 3 feet 3 inches in diameter, and 6 feet long (inside measure) must
be made of ordinary boards, with an interior 4-inch timber rim at the
bottom, and let down into the well as soon as water is reached. The
_rim_ forms the foundation of the brick-work. After laying a few courses
around, say to the hight of one or two feet, their added weight will
force them (curb and all) downwards under the water as fast as the
depth is increased. The clear inside diameter, when finished, is 2 feet
10 inches; the top courses of brick, to the depth of 3 feet, should be
laid in cement mortar; all others laid “dry.” The Cistern is constructed
entirely of brick and cement mortar, in the earth; 7 feet across, and
8 feet deep in the clear. The frame of the house is of spruce timber,
siding of clear pine, beveled clapboards, laid on sheathing-felt. Roofing
of cedar shingles, laid “three thick” on spruce lath. The cornices have
projections of two inches for each foot of their hight from the ground,
which is appropriate for buildings of this character, and is double
that of the usual styles. These projections are ceiled underneath with
tongued and grooved boards, and bracketed with chamfered timber trusses.
Openings are made through the gable cornices to allow for the escape of
heated air from under the roof. The flooring is of 9-inch tongued and
grooved spruce plank. All windows above the cellar have 1½-inch sash, and
outside blinds. Doors are panelled and moulded. The inside trimmings are
quite plain, single moulded, with bold members. The upper frame-work of
the piazza is left exposed on the underside, and is neatly dressed and
chamfered. The first-story stairs are strongly constructed of pine, with
newel, rail, and balusters of black walnut.

DESIGN XXX.

A FRAME AND BRICK FARM-HOUSE COSTING $3,300.


These designs represent a farm-house having an air of substantial comfort
and refinement, and affording ample space and convenience for a large
family.... EXTERIOR, (fig. 125.)—This style admits of the simplest
and most economical finish, is susceptible of almost any degree of
irregularity, and is therefore suitable for the greater number of rural
buildings. The indestructible covering of the side-walls and roofs has
the merit and appearance of permanency.... CELLAR, (fig. 126.)—The
central division is 7 feet high, has five windows, and outside door,
and a stairway leading up to the kitchen. The girders under the first
floor beams are supported on large posts, standing on firmly-imbedded
flat stones.... FIRST STORY, (fig. 127.)—Hight of the ceilings, 11 feet
in main house, and 9 feet in the one-story wings at the side and rear.
The parlor, sitting-rooms, kitchen, and front hall, are in the main
house. The rear wing contains a summer kitchen, bath-room, and a large
kitchen pantry. The side wing is divided into a bed-room, clothes-press,
and pantry. The Parlor, Sitting-room, and Bed-room face the front. The
Kitchen is the largest apartment, and is arranged to be used as the
Living-room. It has windows in each end, an outside door leading to
a pleasant veranda, is in direct communication with the front hall,
sitting-room, summer kitchen, two pantries, and the cellar stairs. The
Summer Kitchen, intended to relieve the larger room of the heavier work,
is furnished with a range, boiler, sink, pump, and wash-tubs, and has
an outside door. The Bath-room is situated at the side of the summer
kitchen, and contains a bath-tub and a seat-closet. A tank 3 × 3 × 6
feet, is placed between the ceiling and roof of this wing, and arranged
to receive rain-water from the main roof. A force-pump is set near the
iron sink, and arranged to supply water from the cistern to the tank,
when the rain supply is exhausted. It will be observed that all the
plumbing apparatus is placed in close proximity, thus insuring economy
in the cost of their introduction, and also that their location prevents
any serious injury that might arise from a chance bursting, or through
carelessness. No windows are shown at the rear of the summer kitchen,
or bath-room, this space being reserved for any additions that may be
desired for fuel, etc.... SECOND STORY, (fig. 128.)—Hight of ceilings,
9 feet. There are five chambers, a hall, and two closets in this story.
Each chamber is of good dimensions, well lighted (twelve windows in
this story,) and may be warmed if required, either by stoves placed in
them or through pipes inserted in the flues for the introduction of hot
air from heaters in the first story, as described for Design XXXII....
ATTIC.—A flight of stairs, located above those of the first story, and
inclosed with narrow ceiling, with a door at the foot, leads to the
garret or attic. This story is thoroughly timbered and floored, but
otherwise unfinished.... CONSTRUCTION.—The foundation walls are of broken
stone, laid in good mortar, 18 inches thick, and show 2 feet above the
final grade of the surrounding earth. The materials of the frame are
indicated in the estimate below, and are framed together, and raised in
the usual manner, except that the sills are placed 4 inches back from
the face of the foundation, to provide a footing for the water-table and
brick inclosing. The _inside_ of the exterior frame is roughly ceiled
around with hemlock boards, which are thoroughly nailed to the studding,
bringing them “into line,” and making them firm. The method of inclosing
the sides of the building is shown in fig. 129. _A_ is the foundation;
_B_ the water-table; _C_ the brick wall; _D_, inside boarding; _E_, _E_,
_E_, timber of the frame. The water-table, of dressed stone, is laid on
the foundation in cement mortar. The brick are laid in “stretchers,” in
good lime and sand-mortar, with close joints. Anchor nails (fig. 130) are
driven in each stud in contact with the upper surfaces of every fifth
course of brick, as shown in the sketch. The window sills are of smoothly
dressed stone, set in the regular manner. The window and door frames
are made as for 8-inch brick-work. The heads are arched over with brick
projecting half an inch beyond the face of the walls, forming a coping
to the windows. The anchor nails are made of ordinary galvanized ⅛-inch
fence-wire; 6 inches long is required for each nail, 1 inch of both ends
being bent at a right angle, and one end is flattened to be easily driven
into the studding, and the opposite end is imbedded in the joints of
the brick-work. These nails are best applied by a carpenter employed to
accompany the masons in their work. This mode of building exterior walls
may be new to many persons, but it has been demonstrated and proved to be
thoroughly practical, and for many reasons preferable to the usual “solid
brick” wall; it is less expensive, does not retain moisture, requires
no “furring off,” or “filling in,” and attachments of cornices, stoops,
or balconies, are easily made to connect with the inside frame work....
The main and wing roofs are covered with dark 8 × 16-inch slate, laid 7
inches to the weather. Mason’s lath are put on the inside boarding in
a vertical manner, 16 inches apart, and the interior of the two full
stories is lathed, plastered, and otherwise fully completed.

DESIGN XXXI.

A HOUSE COSTING $3,700.


The plans here given are somewhat peculiar in arrangement, intended for
a compact and economical residence or parsonage, containing thirteen
rooms, ample halls, eleven closets, large cellar, heater, range, cold
and hot water, and, in fact, all the necessary modern improvements
suitable for the uses of a good-sized family.... EXTERIOR.—The general
outline is nearly square, 26 × 30 feet, affording the most simple and
economical form of construction, and embraces a much better opportunity
for the most desirable distribution of rooms. The porch, bay-window,
and lobby, provide projections that serve to break up and relieve the
monotony usually observed in square buildings. Three elevations (figs.
131, 132, 133,) are given, from which choice can be made, according to
the situation of the building.... INTERIOR.—It will be observed that
the arrangements of the interior partake very much of the character
of a “double house,” particularly in the upper stories.... CELLAR,
(fig. 134.)—The Cellar extends under the whole house, and contains the
heater and bins for coal, etc. The Heater (“portable”) is arranged to
provide warm air to each room in the two principal stories, except the
kitchen.... FIRST STORY, (fig. 135.)—The Entrance, or Reception Hall, is
large, and contains the principal stairway of the house, so arranged
that the quarter-circle is about midway of their hight, placing the niche
down, where it adds greatly to the good appearance of the hall. The
principal rooms, Parlor and Dining-room, where it is usual for the family
to congregate, are large and accessible. Each has a large bay-window,
adding to its area, and supplying a pleasant outlook. The Kitchen
adjoins the dining-room and the rear entrance, or lobby, and has direct
communication with the cellar-stairway through a door. It is provided
with a range, boiler, sink, pump, and wash-tubs, complete. The Lobby,
or rear entrance, is arranged to connect by doors with the dining-room,
kitchen, and private stairway leading to the second floor.... SECOND
STORY, (fig. 136.)—The method of erecting the stairs make them “land”
nearly in the center of the second story. Very little space is required
for the second-story hall, leaving almost this entire floor to be “laid
off” in rooms. These rooms may all be used as chambers, or either of
them may be used as a study. Doubtless the room directly above the front
entrance would be best adapted for that purpose. The door leading to this
room should have ground-glass upper panels to supply light to the hall
of this story.... ATTIC, (fig. 137.)—The Attic story is reached by the
stairway shown at the front end of the second-story hall, which has a
door at the foot of them to shut off all communication at pleasure. This
story is divided into four rooms, four closets, and hall. The Hall is
lighted through an opening, or skylight, in the roof, which also serves
as a ventilator. The School, or Play-room, is put in this part of the
house, where noise is less likely to disturb the older members of the
household. A Work-shop, having ample space for a work-bench, wood-lathe,
and other tools, is provided for in our plan on the third floor....
The estimate appended indicates the general character of the work to
be good and substantial. Provision is made for brick foundations, a
regular timber frame, double siding, slate and tin roofs, outside blinds,
panelled doors, simple and appropriate trimmings throughout, with marble
mantles and stucco cornices in the principal rooms of the first story.
The figures set down for the cost of windows, bays, porch, lobby, and
doors, include materials and labor. The figures for carpenters’ labor are
for the balance of such work.

DESIGN XXXII.

A HOUSE COSTING $4,000.


This plan of a large house provides ample and conveniently-arranged
apartments, containing the most requisite of modern improvements,
suitable to the requirements of a good-sized family. The general outline
of the ground plan is nearly square—30 × 36 feet—securing the greatest
economy in expense of construction, and embracing a liberal provision
for comfort, and a suitable regard for appearances, without sacrificing
one for the other. There is always a certain boldness in the exterior,
or _elevation_, of a square double front, which no other style affords,
expressive of substantial dignity. The two Bay-windows and Porch are
united in construction, the porch having its ends partly sheltered by the
projecting bay-windows, is a pleasant feature. The second story, attic,
and cupola windows, have circular heads, with heavy dressing. The main
Cornice is heavily trussed; the Cupola is large and roomy, and all are
proportioned to make this house worthy of almost any situation.... The
CELLAR extends under the whole house, with walls of hard brick and mortar
8 inches thick, and 7 feet high, and should extend 1½ inches outside of
the frame-work of the house, so as to be “flush” with the sheathing. The
cross-walls, as shown on the plan, are of the same materials; all such
walls should have “heading-courses” every 20 inches, and if in sandy
bottom, a suitable bedding should be provided, as described for Design
XII., which will insure a perfectly safe and satisfactory foundation. The
AREA walls should be made of hard brick, with stone coping and steps,
laid in cement mortar. All chimneys should be started and laid up with
the foundation, and the materials interlaced to bind them together;
this will insure additional strength to both foundation and chimney. We
recommend plastering, or “laying off” the ceiling of the cellar, with
one coat of brown mortar, at a cost of $25, which would be a permanent
benefit to the whole house, in preventing the damp cellar air from rising
up through the floors and frame-work of the house. Such air is almost
sure to be vitiated by decaying vegetable matter, and is the undoubted
source of much disease. Another advantage derived from such plastering
is the shutting out of rats and mice from the frame-work of the house,
and lastly, it affords an opportunity of purifying and sweetening the
cellar easily by (the simplest of all means) a coat of white-wash....
The materials used in the Frame are indicated in the estimate appended
below. Sills should be framed for each cross and outside wall, so as to
secure equal bearings, and allow for even shrinkages; and when put in
position, they should be bedded in mortar, to prevent any inequalities in
the bearings of the frame-work, to strengthen the foundation, and also
to effectually shut out cold air from getting between the cellar ceiling
and the first floor. All beams and studding are placed 16 inches from
centers. The first tier of beams should be framed into the sills, and
their tenons wedged from the outside, to “draw them home.” They should
also bear upon the wall equally with the sill. All beams having a span
of 12 feet and over, should have at least one row of cross-bridging of
1¼ × 3-inch “fencing.” The second and third story beams are notched over
the ties, and spiked fast. The cupola posts rest directly on the center
girts, and the principal roof-timbers are framed and secured to these
posts. In this frame there need be no tendency to self-destruction,
so common in large buildings, such as oblique or outward thrusts, or
irregularity of bearings, but a perfect “repose” is secured to every
piece of timber in the house.... The BAY-WINDOW frame-work (see fig. 140)
is 1 inch less in depth than the principal sills of the house, to allow
for the thickness of the boarding beneath them, so that the water-table,
when put around the house may be in line. The distances given on the
diagram of the bay frame may be relied upon as correct. “Bay-windows are
apt to be cold,” is often said, but a sure preventive of such “cold”
is easily secured by filling in between the beams and panels with dry
sand, which will make them as tight as any other part of a house.—The
_character_ and _quality_ of a house depends greatly upon the material
and manner of SIDING. In our estimate we have provided for mill-worked
sheathing, which should be put on diagonally, and thoroughly nailed to
the frame, which will serve the double purpose of securing more warmth
and strength than any “filling in” of brick, and is less expensive. A
strip of the same thickness as the sheathing, and 2 inches wide, should
be first nailed to the sill, close down to the masonry, to prevent the
air from entering the joints of the sheathing, and following them upwards
into the house. Tarred paper is next stretched over the sheathing,
when the window-frames, water-table, and corner-boards should be set,
and lastly, the novelty-siding put on, and double-nailed to each stud.
The Windows are arranged for each sash to be hung, and all to have
blinds. All windows above the first story have “circular heads,” with
caps turned of 4-inch timber. The Keys shown on the elevation are sawed
out at the back, so as to fit over the caps (not cut through them).
This is much simpler, more ornamental, and does not impair or affect
the solid head.—The roof projects 27 inches beyond the frame of the
building, and is covered with IC. charcoal tin, laid and soldered in
the best manner, on sound hemlock boards. The gutters of the main house
are made as described for Design V.... The FIRST STORY plan (fig. 141)
shows the general division of four rooms and three halls. The Entrance
Hall, or Reception Room, is 7 × 12 feet. The Stairway Hall is also 7
× 12 feet. The Rear Hall is 7 × 7 feet. These halls are divided from
each other by sash doors. The entrance hall is divided from the parlor
and dining-room by large _double_ doors. The advantages of dividing the
halls in the manner shown will be obvious to any one when they consider
how cold, windy, and cheerless most halls are. By this arrangement all
drafts are prevented, either when opening the entrance door, or when
passing from one room to another. The inside double doors may be swung
open altogether, throwing the principal rooms of the lower floor into
one spacious apartment, if occasion should require, for a large company,
without altering to any material degree the temperature of these rooms.
The stairway hall contains the principal stairs, which are of the easiest
“platform” construction, so arranged that a more private stairway is
entirely unnecessary. The rear hall is the common hall of the house, and
is easily reached from every part. The Parlor is the largest room, has a
bay-window, marble mantle, and fire-place heater, and is separated from
the library by sliding doors. The Dining-room has also a bay-window,
marble mantle, and fire-place heater, and is intended as the Living-room.
It is conveniently connected with the kitchen, stairway hall, entrance
hall, and has a good pantry (_c_). The Kitchen is separated from the
dining-room by a single door, and in close proximity to the rear
entrance and cellar stairway doors. It contains one large closet, range
with elevated oven, warm-closet, and water-back, boiler, sink, and
wash-tubs. The Kitchen should be wainscoted 3 feet high, with ⅝ × 3-inch
ceiling-boards. The clock and lamp-shelf should be put between the
closet and hall doors, and not over the range. The advantage of having
the kitchen on the same floor with the dining-room must be apparent to
every one.... The SECOND STORY plan (fig. 142) is divided into four large
chambers, a child’s bedroom, a bath-room, five closets, with a good-sized
hall. The two Front Chambers are heated by hot air from the “fire-place”
heaters of the first story, so that they are always comfortable in the
coldest weather. For many reasons we prefer the fire-place heaters over
any other. They take little room, are cheerful in appearance, easy of
management, and economical, requiring attention but twice in twenty-four
hours, if hard coal is used. Each heater will keep two ordinary sized
rooms comfortable in winter, and are not unsightly in summer. Like any
other device for heating, the perfect and satisfactory results depend
altogether on the manner of setting them. In no case should a heater be
expected to develop its full power when placed in a fire-place in so
close proximity with the brick as to allow the hot air to strike against
and be absorbed by them. The heater should be enclosed in a jacket of
sheet-iron, having an 8-inch opening, and a collar at the top. Attached
to the collar, and “built in” the chimney, should be an 8-inch tin pipe,
connecting with the register-box in the second story. Above this box
this flue should be entirely closed. The smoke-pipe should be 4-inch,
and pass up through the 8-inch tin pipe to the register-box, where an
elbow should be put on, turning the smoke into the side flue adjoining.
The side flue should have no other side openings. The Bath-room has
bath-tub, seat-closet, wash-basin, with cold and hot water faucets. Each
chamber to the right of the hall to have wash-basins. These Chambers have
marble mantle shelves, resting on plaster trusses, at an expense of $6
each, which answer the purpose that a $20 mantle would, and are really
more cheerful and appropriate for such rooms.... The Attic is reached
by the enclosed stairway, and is arranged so that two or four bedrooms
may be “finished off” as required. The Tank is placed on the floor over
the bath-rooms, and is supplied partly from the roof, and partly by the
force-pump in the kitchen. All the remaining space in the attic may be
used for storage, etc.... The Cupola-room is 7 × 7 feet, reached by
a light stairway. The head-room is made to subserve the purpose of a
stand or table, so that really very little room is taken away by the
stairs.... Very few people have any definite idea of the expense of the
separate items that are comprehended under the head of Plumbers’ Work.

DESIGN XXXIII.

A BRICK HOUSE COSTING $4,000.


This plan was designed for the residence of Dr. Samuel McClure, of
Olney, Ill. The style and general characteristics are significant of
elegance and comfort, and suggest its adaptation to suburban, rather
than the more rural situations.... ELEVATION, (fig. 143.)—There is a
peculiar compactness in the outlines of the principal building, while
the piazza and tower contribute largely to the symmetry and gracefulness
of the entire structure. The general details of the exterior are quite
simple in themselves, and are so proportioned and arranged as to
adapt them to each other with artistic effect, and to produce marked
features of unity and completeness.... FIRST STORY, (fig. 144.)—Hight
of ceiling, 11 feet. The general divisions and arrangements are simple
and practical. The principal entrance from the piazza is through outside
and vestibule doors. The outside doors are made in pairs, with solid
panels heavily moulded on the face. The vestibule doors are of similar
construction, except that their upper panels are of glass. There is a
seeming extravagance in such “vestibules,” or duplication of doors,
at the entrance of any dwelling, and they may be regarded as a luxury
rather than a necessity, and would be superfluous and inappropriate in
the ordinary cottage or farm-house; but in residences of this character,
where there is abundant space, such vestibules are manifestly proper,
adding a feature of elaborateness, and providing for many contingencies
of times and seasons. The outside, or storm-doors, afford protection
against extreme cold and severe storms, and furnish additional security.
The vestibule, or “glass” doors, admit an abundance of cheerful light
to the hall. The Main Hall is roomy, and contains the principal stairs,
which are of platform construction, are wide, and have hard-wood rail,
balusters, and newel. The Parlor and Dining-room adjoin the hall
through large double doors. The parlor and bed-room are separated by
sliding doors. The Bed-room has doors leading to the principal hall
and to the bath-room, which has a wash-basin and water-closet. The
Kitchen is supplied with a range, with elevated oven and a water-back;
a 30-gallon copper boiler, a sink with closet underneath, a pump, and
stationary wash-tubs in three divisions, and it connects through doors
with the dining-room, rear lobby, cellar-stairway, a large pantry, and
a dish-closet. The Rear Lobby is arranged to connect with the rear
entrance, kitchen, bath-room, and principal hall. The Bath-room contains
a tank, with a capacity for four hogsheads of water (placed near the
ceiling), bath-tub, washstand, and seat-closet. Lead pipes necessary for
the supply and distribution of cold and hot water, are provided in the
kitchen and bath-room. Marble mantles are provided for the principal
rooms of this story, at an average cost of $25 each. Double architraves
are intended for the trimmings of the windows and doors in the principal
apartments, and neat chair-backs are provided for the dining-room
and kitchen.... SECOND STORY (fig. 145.)—By the peculiar method of
constructing the roof and frame-work, it will be found that the inside
walls of this story are vertical or plumb, instead of angling as in the
usual Mansard roof. The ceiling is 9 feet high. This story has a hall,
four large and one small rooms, five closets, and a stairway to the
tower. Each of the four large chambers have marble shelves resting on
plaster trusses, as described in Design XXXII. Single architraves are
intended for the trimming of this story.... CONSTRUCTION of the Walls
and Roof.—The excavations are made 1½ foot deep, and the earth thrown
out is used in grading around the house at completion, raising the
surrounding surface 1 foot. The foundation and cross-walls (fig. 146)
are 6½ feet high. The principal walls resting on the foundation are 14
feet 3 inches high, and the walls of the tower extend 11 feet 6 inches
above the principal walls. The walls inclosing the wing in the rear are
10 feet high; all of hard burned brick and good mortar. The exterior
walls of the foundation are 12 inches thick, and all other walls are 8
inches thick, and have heading courses every 2 feet. The bottom courses
of the exterior foundation, to the hight of 2½ feet, are laid in mortar
composed of hydraulic cement and sharp sand, to prevent the absorption
of dampness from the earth; all other mortar is composed of lime and
sand. All exterior surfaces of brick-work that are exposed to view have
“flush-joints,” and those intended for painting should be rubbed smooth.
All windows for the cellar and first story have sills of dressed stone,
and have heads neatly arched of brick-work. The window-caps for the first
story windows are laid of brick, as shown in sketch, (fig. 147). These
caps are easily executed while constructing the walls, and are quite
ornamental; the figures on the sketch denote the distances or projections
of the several parts beyond the face of the wall.... Plates of 3 × 8
timber are laid flatwise on top of the brick walls, and the upper or roof
framework is added as shown in section, (fig. 148): _A_, foundation, 12
inches thick; _B_, principal wall, 8 inches thick; _C_, _C_, tower walls;
_D_, _D_, tower posts, 4 × 6 inches, adjoining the upper portion of tower
walls, and forming a part of the tower; _E_, _E_, principal plates, 3 ×
8 laid on brick work; _F_, tie, 3 × 8, resting on 2 × 4 studding, placed
inside the wall, and nailed to the principal plates; _G_, _G_, rafters
sawed to pattern, the lower end projects one inch beyond the face of the
wall. _H_, ceiling timbers resting on the ties. The remaining framework
will be readily understood. The roofs are inclosed with rough hemlock
boards of even thickness, and thoroughly nailed to the rafters—and lastly
covered with IC. charcoal tin. The method of laying the tin on the
upright or Mansard part of the roof, is known in the trade as the “raised
groove” plan, in which all the vertical joints of the tin are raised and
folded, leaving an elevated seam or ridge, which stiffens the general
surface, and adds to the picturesqueness of this form of roof, without
increasing its cost. The balance of the tinning is laid with the ordinary
lock-joint and soldered. _Gas pipes_ are inserted in the framework so as
to be concealed, except where they appear for attachments for 4 ceiling
lights, and 4 side lights in the first story; for 8 side lights in the
second story; for 1 ceiling light in the tower, and for 1 side light in
the cellar. Ample opportunities for a thorough _Ventilation_ are provided
for in this plan. It will be seen that the four large rooms have windows
in two of their sides, affording the most certain and satisfactory means
of ventilation known.—Flues are also provided adjoining each room in
which registers are put, for use in the more severe weather. Provision
is made for the escape of the air from between the ceiling of the second
story and the roof.—Five strong tin 4-inch tubes, with funnel covers,
are inserted in the deck of the principal roof; four of them are placed
3 feet behind the chimneys, and one near the rear, connecting with a
flattened tube leading directly from the bath-room.... The following
ESTIMATE of the quantities of materials and labor, of their several
kinds, and their cost, embraces everything necessary to the completion
of the house, excepting the appliances for heating, which may consist of
a furnace, fire-place heaters, or open grates, as shall be best adapted
to the location. In this vicinity, where hard coal is the chief fuel, we
would suggest a furnace, placed in the cellar, with large pipes arranged
to convey warm air to the different parts of the house. In localities
where bituminous coal is used, the open grate gives good results, and
is exceedingly cheerful in appearance. There are ranges and parlor
stoves constructed to burn soft coal successfully, and it is undoubtedly
possible that heating furnaces may be adapted to the use of the same fuel.

DESIGN XXXIV.

COUNTRY RESIDENCE COSTING $4,750.


On the next page is a perspective view of a residence built for Dr. B.
Clark, of Washington, Pa., from special designs made by me in 1876. The
style and general arrangements are similar to the one built for Dr.
McClure, last described, with the addition of a side extension or office,
and the completion of rooms in the basement for laundry purposes, and a
laboratory. This Building is substantially constructed, and tastefully
finished throughout. The hight of the ceilings in the first story are
12 feet, in the second 10 feet, and for the basement 8 feet. It has two
heaters, four open grates, a range, complete apparatus in bath rooms,
and distributing pipes for cold and hot water. The principal rooms are
frescoed, all others are kalsomined. A Reservoir constructed in the rear
part of the cellar, and provided with running spring water, is arranged
as a receptacle for milk cans, and supplies the Fountain shown in the
front lawn (this fountain, owing to the sloping surface of the grounds,
is several feet below the foundations of the house).... Dr. Clark moved
into his new house during the first week in February last, and writes
with reference to it, that “all in all it is the most tasteful in outside
appearance, convenient, and economically constructed building in this
section, and attracts a great deal of attention.”

The cost of this building, everything complete, was $4,750.




DESIGN XXXV.

A HOUSE COSTING $4,000.


These plans were designed for a suburban residence, to take the
place of one recently destroyed by fire. The original structure was
cubiform in outline, resembling a huge box; with unbroken facades,
and flat roof, destitute of beauty, and in strange contrast with the
tasteful surroundings. The owner desired to use the old foundations,
still in fair condition, without disturbing the grounds, underlying
pipes, etc., and thus retain the nearly square ground plan, but a
building with an exterior agreeing with the surroundings. While the
main object in presenting this design is to show that the ground
plans do not necessarily determine the style of exterior dress, its
general arrangement and character will be found to deserve favorable
consideration.... ELEVATION, (fig. 150.)—There is a constant demand for
“Mansard Roofs,” arising from an aspiration for structures signifying
originality and progressiveness. The animated features of this style
accord with activity, rather than of retirement, and adapt it to
prominent situations, skirting the more public thoroughfares. The
objections to such roofs result from their frequent misapplication.
They are manifestly inappropriate for retired or secluded situations,
or for persons of purely domestic tastes. They also lose their identity
and expressiveness when duplicated in close and continuous proximity,
as is often done in towns. But this is true of any other style. Variety
is the spice of architecture.... CELLAR, (fig. 151.)—Hight of 8 feet in
clear. It has an outside rear entrance, is well lighted, and contains
ample space for the furnace, and divisions for coal, vegetables, etc....
FIRST STORY, (fig. 152.)—Hight of ceilings, 10 feet. The accommodations
are conveniently arranged, and sufficient for a large family. The main
entrance from the piazza is through large double doors and a vestibule.
The Hall is central and spacious, communicating with the principal
rooms, and rear entry, and contains the main stairs, which are unusually
wide and easy. The Parlor and Library, divided by large sliding doors,
can be used separately, or together as one spacious room when desired.
The Dining-room and Kitchen adjoin, and have the necessary pantries,
range, pump, sink, and stationary wash-tubs, with cold and hot water. A
Conservatory is entered from the dining-room through double sash doors,
adding a cheerful feature to this apartment, where the family spend much
of their time. The rear may be reached from the dining-room in three
ways—by the main hall and rear entry, or through the kitchen, or most
pleasantly through the conservatory.... SECOND STORY, (fig. 153.)—Hight
of ceilings 9 feet. The divisions include a hall, four large chambers
with closets to each, a front hall bed-room, and a bath-room. Each of
the chambers has windows in two sides, giving opportunity for plentiful
light and fresh air. The clear width of the room sections, (5 yards
each), favors the economical cutting of carpets. The main stairs are
made continuous to the attic story. The Bath-room is furnished with a
bath-tub, wash-bowl, and seat-closet, and with cold and hot water....
CONSTRUCTION.—The foundations, stone-sills, area stoops, framing,
inclosing, flooring, plastering, and painting, are similar to those
described for Design XIII. Care should be taken in covering the roofs,
as the materials used (wood, tin, and slate), are entirely foreign to
each other, and can only be placed in _contact_, and indirectly united.
The wood should be thoroughly seasoned, to prevent a future disturbance
of the exterior covering. All flashings along the sides of the dormers
and other uprights should be 10 inches wide, and double painted before
being used. The conservatory is not floored, but is filled in with earth
level with the foundation walls. A walk is laid through the center, of 1⅛
× 4-inch slats, and the remaining space is devoted to plants. A furnace
is placed in the cellar, with pipes to convey warm air to the principal
rooms and halls of both stories, and to the conservatory. The pipes and
register boxes for conveying warm air to the second story, are placed
in the chimneys while building them. There are open fire-places in the
principal rooms, with marble mantles in the first story, and marble
shelves in the chambers. Stucco cornices and centers, of appropriate
patterns, are put in the principal rooms and hall of the first story. A
hall and stairway leading to the tower, is completed in the ATTIC, the
other portions of the third story are unfinished, but may be converted
into pleasant rooms for school purposes, or chambers, as desired.

DESIGN XXXVI.

A FARM HOUSE COSTING $5,000.


The plans here given were originally designed for the residence of Mr. F.
H. Johnston, Easton, Md. They will interest those desiring a good-sized,
comfortable farm-house.... EXTERIOR, (fig. 154).—The site in this case
being midway between the highway and a water front, (facing a tributary
of the Chesapeake,) made it desirable to have two main entrances, adapted
to either approach, and indicated the position of the kitchen wing
at the _side_. The Conservatory is in an angle facing the southeast.
The Piazza and Roof Projections are of ample breadth to give abundant
shade, and proper effect. As a whole, the outlines are rounded and
compact, indicating completeness and strength—always desirable features
in buildings of this class.... CELLAR, (fig. 155).—Hight of ceiling 8
feet. It has 13 windows, and outside and hatchway doors. Openings in the
chimneys provide ventilation. The ceilings are plastered, to prevent
the ascent of damp and unwholesome vapors through the frame-work of
the house.... FIRST STORY, (fig. 156).—Hight of the ceilings in the
main house, 11 ft. 4 in., and in the wing 9 ft. The main entrances lead
from the piazzas, through large double doors, to the principal Hall,
which is wide, and extends, unobstructed, through the house. The main
stairs occupy the space at the right, which is separated by an arch that
preserves the continuity of the hall ceiling. The ordinary or family
entrance is by way of the passage, and is convenient to all the parts
of the house in daily use. A private stairway leads from the passage to
the second story. The Parlor and Library are separated by sliding doors,
and each has a bay and other windows. The Dining-room at the right is
pleasantly arranged; it may be entered from the main hall, or through the
conservatory, or by the passage, or through the butler’s pantry. Wide
double sash-doors lead to the conservatory, and single sash-doors open
to the piazza through the passage. The Kitchen has doors leading to the
passage, butler’s pantry, cellar, and yard, and has three windows. It is
provided with a range, pump, boiler, wash-tubs, and sink. The Butler’s
Pantry is spacious; one end is dresser finished, with counter-shelf and
doors above and below. A counter-shelf is also placed at the opposite
end, with wash-tray and closet. The sides are shelved around, and have
cleats and hooks.... SECOND STORY, (fig. 157).—Hight of ceilings in
the main house 10 feet; in the wing 9 feet. The divisions embrace six
rooms, six closets, and the required halls. The platform of the main
stairs is level with the second floor of the wing, and from it a door
leads to the wing passage. The Bath-room has a bath-tub, wash-stand, and
seat-closet, and a good-sized closet for towelling, etc. All closets
have the usual shelving and hooks. Each chamber has marble shelves and
stucco trusses.... ATTIC.—The stairs leading to this story are above
the main flight, inclosed with narrow ceiling, and have a door at the
foot. There are two circular windows in each end gable, and one in
each front. The whole is floored, but otherwise unfinished, to be used
as an open garret.... CONSTRUCTION.—The excavations are 4 feet deep,
and the loose earth thrown out is neatly graded around, leaving three
feet of the foundations exposed to sight. The foundations are of hard
burned brick, 12 inches thick for the main house, and 8 inches for the
wing and conservatory. Brick piers, 12 inches square, are built for the
piazza supports. The first story frame-work is beam-filled with bricks,
where they rest on the foundation. This prevents draughts of air from
entering the house between the foundation and the frame, and also keeps
mice out of the frame at this point—_the latter is especially necessary
along the lines of the main partitions_. The chimneys are of hard brick,
arranged with continuous flues from each fire-place to the top. Tin
8-inch pipes, with the necessary elbows and register boxes, are inserted
while building, to convey warm air from the cellar to the large chambers
in the second story. The frame-work is constructed in the most thorough
manner, of sound pine or spruce timber. The siding is of clear pine
clapboard, laid on sheathing felt. Cornices of dressed pine. Principal
roofing of cedar shingles. Piazza and bay window roofs of tin. Flooring
of narrow yellow pine. The first and second stories are completed in
every respect, ready for occupation. Each of the principal rooms and the
main hall have stucco cornices and centers. Arches with neat ornamental
corbels are built across each bay window, over the =L= adjoining the main
hall, and at the entrance of the passage leading to the bed-room in the
second story. All sashes are 1½-inch thick, and glazed with four lights
in each pair. Blinds (outside) are properly hung and fastened to each
window above the cellar. The conservatory is substantially constructed
of light frame-work, with no superfluous dressing to obstruct the light,
and glazed with plain, single-thick glass at the sides, and ribbed glass
for the roof, has a narrow walk of slat-work leading from the dining-room
door, and is arranged to be heated in winter from a furnace in the
cellar. All parts usually painted, have two coats of best paint, of color
and materials selected by the owner.

DESIGN XXXVII.

A HOUSE COSTING $7,000.


The accompanying plans were designed for a suburban residence erected
during the past year by Mr. Bernhard Greeff, at College Point, Long
Island, N. Y. The general outlines were determined with especial
reference to the location—which is elevated, overlooking the East River
to the north and west, Flushing bay, and the village to the south, and
with an eastward frontage to the street, giving pleasant views in all
directions. With these points fixed, it is easy to see the propriety of
placing a broad side to the bleak or northern exposure, and putting such
breaks or angles as are required in the more sheltered directions....
EXTERIOR, (fig. 158.)—The style of this example is homelike, and shows to
the best advantage when placed in comparison with those of more fanciful
design. Sufficient irregularities are made in angles and projections
to give variety. The details shown in the front finish are continued
around the sides and rear. The hight of the rear wing is one story less
than the main house. While the appearance of this house is agreeable
on every side, the most pleasing is from the southerly direction....
CELLAR, (fig. 159.)—Hight of ceiling 7 feet, of which 4 feet are above
ground. All parts are well lighted with windows, except the hall, which
has a sash-door with iron guard. The Laundry has an open stairway to
the kitchen, and is provided with wash-tubs. A water-closet is placed
under the stair. A furnace is placed in the northern division of the
cellar, with pipes for conducting warm air to each room and hall in the
two stories of the main house, and to the bath-room.... FIRST STORY,
(fig. 160.)—Hight of ceilings in main house 11 feet; in rear wing 8
feet 5 inches. The Front Entrance is through a vestibule leading to
the main hall. The Hall is large, contains the principal stairs, with
a closet under them, and communicates with the parlor, sitting-room,
and rear entry. The Sitting or Family-room is arranged to be the
pleasantest apartment, has double windows front and rear, (the rear
ones opening to the floor), and a large bay-window giving an outlook
in three directions. Each of the principal rooms has grates for open
fires, side registers leading from the furnace, and marble mantles.
The Rear Entry communicates with the several apartments, and the rear
piazza. The Kitchen has an elevated range, boiler, sink, drain-board,
two closets, and enclosed stairways leading down to the laundry, and up
to the second story; it communicates with the dining-room through the
butler’s pantry, the latter is “dresser-finished” with sash-doors, copper
wash-trays, etc.... SECOND STORY, (fig. 161.)—Hight of ceiling in main
house 10 feet, in wing 9 feet, with side breasts 5 feet. The floor of
the wing is level with the platform of the main stairs. The full ceiling
above this platform is arched over, and conceals the roof angle of the
wing. An inside and smaller arch leads to the passage beyond. Both of
these arches may be seen from the lower hall, and are pleasing features.
An arch between the closets at the opposite end of the hall makes an
alcove to the hall window. The room divisions are similar to those of
the first story. Closets are provided for each chamber. The Bath-room
is conveniently arranged and furnished.... ATTIC.—Hight of ceiling 9
feet, with breast-walls 3 feet. There are 3 good-sized chambers, a hall,
and 7 closets in this story. Four dormer and three gable windows are
provided.... CONSTRUCTION.—The _time_ allowed for the erection of most
buildings is too limited. Although this house was built by contract,
no haste was enjoined, six months being allowed for its completion,
giving the builder an opportunity of selecting the materials and workmen,
and of applying the parts in their proper time and order. The exterior
foundation walls, to the level of the ground, are of broken stone, 18
inches thick; the balance of hard brick, 12 inches thick. The frame is
of full-sized timber; all beams and studding are placed 16 inches from
centers. The siding-boards are 6 inches wide, rabbeted, and laid 5 inches
to the weather, on stiff tarred “sheathing-board,” weighing 1½ pound
to the square yard. The exterior frame is “filled in” with pale brick.
The main and wing roofs are covered with Keystone slate on tarred felt
over hemlock boards. The main gutters are of double cross tin, laid
in with the slate as shown in Design V. The roofs of the piazzas, and
bay-window, are of single cross tin. The cellar bottom is concreted with
hydraulic cement and gravel, 3 in. thick. The laundry and cellar hall
have the usual wide flooring, and are thoroughly plastered and finished.
The partitions in the cellar, and the coal-bins are of dressed plank.
All the floors in the two principal stories are double, the first being
of ordinary dressed flooring—the second is “_parquet_” flooring laid of
¾ × 2½-inch yellow pine, and black walnut. The black walnut is used
only in the borders and centers. These borders are made by laying from
five to eight courses of alternate woods all around the rooms, ending
at the hearths. The widths and arrangements are changed slightly in the
different apartments, to give variety. These floors are intended to
dispense with the use of carpets; rugs, covering the central portions of
the floor, being adopted in their place. Unlike the stationary carpet,
these may be easily removed for airing, and the floors cleaned daily
if desirable. The three upper stories are hard-finished, on two coats
of brown mortar. Each room and hall in the first and second stories of
the main house have suitable stucco cornices and centers. The interior
wood-finish is complete, all of clear and seasoned materials. Bronzed
hardware is used in the first story, and porcelain in the balance of the
building. Gas-pipes are inserted for thirty lights, properly distributed
through the house. Five bells are included in the fittings. All wood,
tin, and exterior brick work has two coats of best paint. The outside
doors, and the halls, are grained in imitation of hard woods. The stair
rails, door saddles, and the hard-wood flooring, are rubbed with linseed
oil. The following are the estimates of the _cost_, as per contracts:

  Mason work, completed.                  $1,650.00
  Roofer’s work,    ”                        337.00
  Carpenter’s work, ”                      3,573.00
  Plumber’s work,   ”                        590.00
  Furnaces,         ”                        200.00
  Mantles,          ”                        300.00
  Painter’s work,   ”                        350.00
                                          ---------
    Total.                                $7,000.00

DESIGN XXXVIII.

A HOUSE COSTING $8,000.


These plans were designed for a large and convenient house, arranged
to embrace nearly all of the modern improvements. Figure 162 is the
perspective view of a house recently built from these plans, for Mr. J.
M. Peck, at Flushing, L. I. The general characteristics of the exterior
are expressive of refinement and cheerfulness. There is considerable
novelty in some of the outlines and details of construction. It will be
seen that the Tower is five stories high, or two stories above the attic
of the main house, affording a lofty outlook. All the long horizontal
lines of cornice are broken up by truss-heads, which are ornamental in
themselves, and give relief from the depressing appearance of such long
lines. The Dormer Windows of the main house have projecting pediments,
with turned columns resting on the outer edge of the main cornice. The
Inclosing of this house is the same as that described for Design XXXII.
The Mansard part of the main roof and tower is covered with dark slate,
laid on sound boards, covered with felt. All other roofs are tinned in
the best manner.... The CELLAR extends under the whole house, and has
outside and cross-walls of hard brick, which, with the chimneys and
area, are built as described in XXXII. A _Furnace_ is put in at _F_,
and enclosed with brick, and 10-inch tin pipes are provided to convey
hot air to the parlors, library, dining-room, and hall of the first
story, to five rooms in the second story, and to the tank-room in the
attic story.... The FIRST STORY contains a large Hall, Parlor, Library,
Dining-room to be used as a Living-room, Kitchen, Butler’s and other
Pantries, Wash-room, two flights of Stairs, the principal one in the main
hall, and a private one adjoining the wash-room. The Main Hall is 7 feet
wide, and is entered from the piazza through heavy front and vestibule
double doors. The front doors are full hight, and have quarter-circle
plate glass “skylights” in them. The vestibule doors have plate glass
upper panels, with transom, and half-circle head-light. Double doors open
from the hall to the parlor and to the dining-room, and large sliding
doors separate the parlor from the library. The _Dining-room_ has a
large bay-window, marble mantel, china closet, and adjoins the butler’s
pantry. The _Kitchen_ is arranged with such conveniences as would delight
the most enthusiastic housekeeper; has large closets, range, sink, cold
and hot water, adjoins the wash-room, cellar stairway, and private
passage, and communicates with the dining-room through the butler’s
pantry. The Range has an elevated oven, warm closet, and water-back. To
secure a perfect ventilation, a large register is placed in the flue of
the chimney, which creates so strong a draft that the air in this room
can all be changed in a few minutes. The left-hand flue of the kitchen
chimney contains the pipes that convey warm air from the furnace to
the bath and tank rooms. The wash-room contains the copper boiler and
wash-tubs, and has a closet under the private stairs. The sink is large,
and is provided with large drain-boards at each side, and a row of
closets underneath. The Butler’s Pantry has complete fittings of drawers,
shelving, oval copper wash-tray, and washstand with marble top, and is
provided with cold and hot water. A Passage or private hall is arranged
to connect with the principal hall, kitchen, private stairway, and rear
entrance; by this plan the principal housework can be done without
intruding in any way on the main hall or principal rooms of the house....
SECOND STORY. This story contains a good-sized hall, 4 large chambers,
a private study, bath-room, store-room, six large closets, and private
stairway. The principal flight of stairs is made continuous from the
first floor to the attic; an arch is placed across the narrow part of the
hall in this story, near the first landing of the principal stairs, and
is in full sight from the hall below, imparting a cheerful and finished
appearance.... ATTIC, _or Third Story_—This story is finished throughout,
and is divided into a hall, two large chambers, with closets to each,
tank-room, and large attic. The stairs to the tower are closed in, and
have a door at the foot. The hall is lighted through a sash-door from
the tank-room. The large attic-room at the right has two doors opening
from the hall, and may be divided into two rooms if required. A large
upper room, where noise will not disturb the occupants of the lower parts
of the house, will always be found valuable for school and play-room
purposes, especially in cold or stormy weather, and when supplied
with a table, benches, maps, books, and apparatus for instruction and
entertainment, will afford the younger members of the family opportunity
for development and exercise.... GENERAL REMARKS.—Many people, who would
adopt this general plan, might conclude that the style of the exterior
is too elaborate and costly. It must be obvious to any one that the
internal arrangements, and ground plan of houses, should be made to
conform to the necessities and requirements of those who are to occupy
them; and these parts being of the first importance, should receive the
first consideration. Such _ground plans_, however, do not decide, or
even indicate, the style, character, or expense, of the outside _dress_
that may be put upon them. Different people have entirely different
characters, tastes, and resources, and the external appearance of their
homes should signify those general qualities and characteristics, and
also accord with, and conform to, all the circumstances of location, and
relation.... The ESTIMATE in detail provides for all work to be done in
a substantial manner, of the usual materials. The exterior and interior
wood finish is of clear pine lumber. The _Plastering_ is hard-finished,
on two coats of brown mortar. Appropriate _Cornices_, _Centers_, and
_Panels_, in stucco, are intended for the hall, parlor, library,
dining-room, and the two front chambers in the second story. _Gas_-pipes
are inserted in the frame-work of the house, with connections arranged
for 37 attachments. These are easily put in during construction, and even
when the house is located far from any city or village having gas, there
is strong probability that ere long we shall have convenient apparatus
for making and supplying gas to isolated dwellings.... PLUMBING is
provided as described in Design XXXII., except that the plumbing required
for the butler’s pantry, is here added. _Bells_ are put in, with their
wires running through zinc tubes concealed in the walls. The front-door
pull leads to a gong in the kitchen. The dining-room has a bell leading
to the school-room in the attic. Each chamber in the second story,
and the bath-room, has a bell leading to the kitchen, and the largest
chamber has a bell leading to the attic. _Speaking_-tubes are provided
for communication between the second story, hall, and bath-room, with
the kitchen.... PAINTING.—The body of the outside is in warm-gray; the
principal outside trimming in pure white, with thin separating lines in
light drab, and blinds in dark-bronze color. All wood, tin, and brick
work, usually painted, both inside and outside, has two coats of the
best lead and oil. All doors are grained—and all hard-wood, such as
stair-rail, balusters, and door-saddles, are rubbed in oil.

DESIGN XXXIX.

CONTIGUOUS HOUSES, COSTING $1,000 EACH.


These plans were originally prepared for six connected cottages, just
completed, for Mr. Fred. Storms, (manufacturer), at Bayside, L. I. They
were designed to give the largest amount of accommodation, convenience,
and finish, possible, for one thousand dollars each, and are especially
adapted to rapidly filling localities, or manufacturing districts.
By this system of building in blocks, a very large saving is made in
materials and labor, at first, and little expense is required to keep
them in order afterwards. Where desired, the introduction of gas, or
water-pipes, may be made, from one to the other direct, at small cost.
Such connected houses are really more comfortable than separate ones,
as they protect each other at their sides from the extreme changes
of the outward temperature; and are therefore warmer in winter, and
cooler in summer. The site chosen in this case is elevated, and has a
westward frontage, securing the important advantages of good drainage,
and the admission of direct sunlight to every room.... EXTERIOR, (fig.
167).—Building in blocks is a favorite mode with many large owners of
village property. The chief objection to a majority of such erections is
their formal and stiff appearance, arising from a monotonous uniformity,
a repetition of parts, and the overpowering predominance of horizontal
lines—partaking too much of the city-street style. To overcome such
objections in this design, simple but effective irregularities were
introduced, so that really no two dwellings are alike. The sky-lines
are broken and varied; the main roofs have pedimented projections—with
Mansard sections intervening; all horizontal lines are either shortened
or omitted, leaving vertical ones to prevail, and the window openings are
varied in their form and distribution. While these several features are
essential to the good appearance of such buildings, giving them the
pleasing elements of variety and picturesqueness, they do not add very
materially to the cost. Cottages designed for simple dwellings, whether
built apart or connected, should, as far as possible, preserve their
identity as cottages, and if destined for undulating and picturesque
situations, should be outlined to accord with their surroundings....
INTERIOR.—The following description of rooms has reference to the
house at the extreme left; its relation with the adjoining one is shown
by the dotted sketch at the side. All have equal accommodations; this
and two others are similarly arranged, the remaining three have their
sides reversed.... CELLAR, (fig. 168.)—Hight of ceilings 6½ feet. It is
thoroughly floored, has outside entrances front and rear, and being well
out of ground, is light and airy, and is adapted to general use for the
coarser work. Bins for coal are placed where they may be readily filled
from the front window. One corner is partitioned off for a bath-room
and water-closet. The window to the latter is shielded by a latticed
inclosure beneath the rear lobby, adding to its privacy. The rear area
not being protected by the rear stoop, has hatchway doors to be used in
stormy weather. The Stairs lead from near the front door, to the main
hall of the first story.... FIRST STORY, (fig. 169.)—Hight of ceilings 10
feet. A hall, parlor, and living-room are embraced in the divisions. The
Hall is entered from a neat porch, contains the main stairs, and leads to
the parlor, living-room, and the cellar stairs. The Parlor is pleasantly
arranged, with double windows in front, has neat stucco cornices and
centers, and a marble mantle. The chimney-breast is placed to allow
sufficient space between it and the central partition, for a piano, or
other large piece of furniture. The Living-room is of good dimensions
and shape, has two windows, a closet, a large fire-place, and a sink.
The door leading to the rear lobby has glass upper panels, admitting
additional light in the room in pleasant weather, when the lobby door
will be likely to stand open, and through it the lobby will be lighted
at night from within. The Main Stairs, leading to the second story, are
of the “quarter-circle” pattern, and are neatly finished with hard-wood
railing, with a niche above.... SECOND STORY, (fig. 170.)—Hight of
ceiling 9 feet. This story is divided into a small hall, two chambers,
two bed-rooms, and three closets. Each of the rooms is well lighted, and
chimney-breasts, with marble shelves, and stucco trusses are finished
in each chamber.... CONSTRUCTION.—The average depth of the excavations
below the surface is three feet. The Foundation walls are of brick work,
8 inches thick, those for the exterior are 7 ft. 4 in. high, showing an
average of 4 ft. above the final grades. (In this particular case, the
site being elevated, only 4 inches of additional filling was required
in the grades, the balance of the loose earth being used to fill more
depressed grounds). All interior cross-walls of brick are omitted, their
places being supplied with brick “footings” and frame-work. These brick
footings are laid in trenches 4 inches below the cellar bottom, and are
8 inches high and wide. Sills of 4 × 6 timber are laid on the center of
these footings (edgewise), leaving a margin of 2 inches on each side for
the support of the ends of the cellar-floor beams. Girts are put above
the sills (also of 4 × 6 timber), anchored to, and level with the outer
foundation walls, and are supported by studding and braces, thus forming
an inexpensive and substantial division and bearing between the cellars.
The principal frame is of regular-sized sawed timber, thoroughly framed
and braced. The sidings are of clear pine clapboards, laid on hard-rolled
sheathing-felt. The upper roofs are covered with IC. charcoal tin,
“tern-plate,” and the Mansard sections are slated on hemlock boards. The
interior flooring is of 7-inch milled spruce; outside flooring of 4½-inch
milled pine. To prevent the transmission of sound, all the main divisions
of frame-work between the houses are deafened by a filling of pale brick
and mortar. The cellar ceilings and side walls are white-finished on one
coat of brown mortar. All other plastering is hard-finished on two coats
of brown mortar. Circular ventilators are placed in each gable, and two
ventilators made to resemble the chimney tops are placed on the higher
or central ridge of the roof, to allow for the escape of heated air
from beneath the roofing. All windows have 1½-inch sash, of four lights
each; those in the cellar are hung with butts; all above are balanced
with iron weights, and have outside blinds. The doors are first quality,
four-panelled. The interior casings are of clear pine, and are neatly
moulded, and the parlor windows have panelled backs. The Painting is done
as described in Design XIII., except that the blinds are of a chocolate
color.

Mr. Storms added about $1,000 to the total cost of six buildings in
plumbing, sewers, gas-pipes, and in fencing separate front and rear
yards, to each house. As these improvements are not generally required,
they are omitted in the estimate.

DESIGN XL.

CONTIGUOUS HOUSES, COSTING $2,000 EACH.


These designs were prepared for a block of five houses erected last year
for Mr. Geo. Storms, facing one of the principal avenues at Bayside, L.
I. The entire structure is 90 feet long, running north and south, and
occupies half the avenue end of a village ground plot. One end section
being a “corner,” has a portion devoted to business purposes, the
balance of the building is used exclusively as residences. They are
thoroughly furnished with ranges, heaters, pipes for cold and hot water,
and gas, and complete sewerage. The desirability of these buildings is
proved by the fact that all of them were engaged, and several occupied,
before they were fully completed.... CELLARS, (fig. 172.)—Hight of
ceilings, 7 feet. Each is well lighted, and has outside entrances from
the street and from rear yards. A hall, laundry, and water-closet are
floored and otherwise finished off; the balance is unfinished, to be
used as a cellar for fuel and vegetables. The Laundry has a set of
stationary wash-tubs, with cold and hot water. The Water-closet has an
outside door leading from the rear yard, (this is designed to obviate
the necessity and unsightliness of the usual out-buildings). The
Fire-places shown are left open, and have continuous flues the whole
hight of the chimneys. These flues being heated through contact with the
upper fires, insures a thorough ventilation of this story.... ELEVATION
(fig. 171.)—This building appears well from all directions, is imposing
in outline, animated in details, and nicely proportioned—the hight
agreeing with its breadth; the openings and dressings are changed in
each story, to give diversity, the whole being well suited to its very
public and prominent situation. The “corner” building has an observatory
extending above the main roofs, indicating its terminal position, and
adding an agreeable feature of irregularity in the sky-lines. The street
end at the rear of the tower has a Mansard roof with two dormers; the
opposite end shows a full pediment.... FIRST STORY, (fig. 173.)—Hight of
ceilings in four houses, 10 feet. The floor in the corner building is
lowered 2½ feet, making that part 12½ feet in the clear. A hall, parlor,
dining-room, and kitchen, are finished in each of the four houses,
and a store, kitchen, and entry, in the corner building. Each of the
parlors has a large bay-window, and is divided from the dining-room
by sliding-doors. The Dining-rooms have two closets each. The Kitchens
are conveniently arranged with closets, ranges, boilers, and sinks. The
Store is fair-sized, has a double door entrance from the avenue, and has
a wide stairway leading directly from it to the cellar. The Kitchen at
the rear is for the use of the parties doing business in the store. The
Family Entrance to the corner building is from the street at the side....
SECOND STORY, (fig. 174.)—Hight of ceilings, 9 feet. The divisions in
this story are similar in each of the five buildings, and consist of a
hall, two large and two small rooms, and the necessary closets. The room
over the store is used as a parlor. One of the small rooms in each house
is fitted as a bath-room. The Stairs leading to the attics are placed
above the main flights, with a door at the foot of each.... ATTIC, (fig.
175.)—The Attic of the corner building is partitioned off, and finished
as shown, with ceilings 9 feet high, and has an inclosed stairway leading
to the observatory. The latter is 7 feet square in the clear, and is
also finished. Each of the four adjoining attics are plastered on their
sides, but have no partitions.... CONSTRUCTION.—The Excavations are
made in the earth for the corner building, to the depth of 5½ feet—and
for the others, 3 feet. The foundations are of 8-inch brick work. The
frame is of sawed, seasoned timber. The main division walls between the
houses are deafened, by filling with pale brick and mortar, “laid flat.”
The sidings are of clear pine clap-boards, laid on rolled sheathing.
The Mansard Roofs for front, one end, rear, and the tower, are slated;
all other roofs are tinned. The interior walls and ceilings of the two
full stories are hard-finished on two coats of brown mortar; the balance
is white-finished on one coat of “laid off” brown mortar. The halls,
parlors, dining-rooms, and store, have stucco cornices and centers in
each, and the openings to the bay windows are arched and moulded. Marble
mantles are put in the principal rooms, and marble shelves and stucco
trusses are put in the large bed-rooms. Fire-place heaters are put in the
parlors, with pipes connecting them with registers in the second story.
The bath-tubs and water-closets are cased with black walnut.... To give
an exact idea of the plumber’s work, the specification used as a guide in
its introduction is herewith given.—PLUMBING:

There must be a hopper water-closet and a wash-tub with three apartments
put in each basement. A No. 2 range, with elevated oven, and water-back;
a 30-gallon oval-topped copper boiler of Croton pressure strength,
resting on an iron Lockwood Stand, and an 18 × 30-inch iron sink in
each kitchen; a bath-tub, 5 feet long, lined with planished copper;
a wash-stand, with 14-inch bowl, marble-top and wall plates; a pan
water-closet, with bowl, pull, and crank attachments; and a tank, 1½ ×
1½ × 3 feet, lined with sheet lead, in each bath-room. All supply pipes
to be of galvanized iron, of the following sizes: The main of 1½-inch,
93 feet long, laid in the cellar bottom below the foundation walls, near
the rear chimneys, one end to extend outside the building for street
connections. Branches of ¾-inch leading from the main supply to the
tank, with secondary branches leading to the hopper-closet, wash-tubs,
and sink. All other water-pipes to be of lead, as follows: For cold
water leading from the tank, to the bath-tub, water-closet, and boiler;
and for hot water leading from the boiler, to the sink, wash-tubs, and
bath-tubs, of A ⅝-inch; for connections between the water-back and
boiler of AA ¾-inch; and for wash-stands of A ½-inch. The water and
hopper closets are to have traps of 4-inch, lead, connecting them with
the soil pipe. Ventilating pipes of 2-inch tin, to lead from the 4-inch
traps to above the roof, and have cone-shaped covers set 2 inches above
their openings. The soil pipes to be of 4-inch iron, and lead from the
second floor to the tile drains at the rear and below the cellar bottom.
Waste pipes to be of 1½-inch, with traps, all of lead, leading from the
bath-tub, wash-bowl, sink, and wash-tubs, to the soil pipe. Brass lever
“stop and waste” cocks must be put in the branch supply pipes near the
basement floors, and in the pipes leading from the tank to the boiler. A
“Fuller’s” Tank Regulator to be connected with the supply pipe leading
to the tank. A “Sediment” cock must be attached to empty the boilers,
with pipes leading to the waste pipes of the sinks. Finished brass ⅝
“compression” cocks, with flanges, and thimbles, must be provided for the
sinks and wash-tubs, and similar cocks, silver-plated, for the bath-tubs;
plated swing cocks for the wash-stands. Self-acting compression cocks
must be put in the connections with the hopper closets. Plugs, with
chains, must be put in each wash-tub and bowl, and trap-screws put in
all traps. Finally, all to be properly connected, in a substantial and
workman-like manner, and warranted one year, with ordinary use.

described. Illustrated. Cloth, 12mo.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
